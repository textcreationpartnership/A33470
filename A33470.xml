            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </opener>
            <p>THat I have prefix'd your Honour'd Name to this Diſcourſe, will not (I am confident) be diſpleaſing to you, for as much as in it I plead that Cauſe, for which you have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd ſo great a Concern: When the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies of the Royal Family were at the higheſt, puff't up with the vain hopes of gaining their ſo much deſired Point, the <hi>Excluſion</hi> of his Royal Highneſs, When they reviled and treated the Oppoſers of that wicked <hi>Project</hi> at their pleaſure: even then, as became a Perſon of Eminent Courage and Loyalty, you declared your juſt Indignation againſt, and condemn'd it as a moſt impious Device.</p>
            <p>And ſeeing one great deſign of this Diſcourſe, is to prove the <hi>Bill</hi> of <hi>Exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> to be as unjuſt as you have always thought it, to whom with greater Reaſon can this that I have writ addreſs it ſelf for protection, than to a Perſon of ſuch known and unqueſtion'd Loyalty, you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing One of thoſe Brave and Loyal Perſons, that truly honour and heartily deſire the Felicity of the King and his moſt Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb facs="tcp:44080:3"/> Family, and this in ſo high a degree that you have ſuffer'd for it, been moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly deprived of a conſiderable part of your Birth-right for no other cauſe at all, but your Devotion to your Prince, and Zeal for his Service? But hereby you will be no looſer in the end, becauſe God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, I am ſure, will bleſs and proſper you, and all good men do, and will love and honour you.</p>
            <p>Beſides, your good opinion of this Diſcourſe that it will be ſerviceable to the Great Ends I writ it for, encouraged me to make it publick, and to put it into the World under your Patronage, not doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but you will accept that, which you were pleaſed to entertain ſuch favourable thoughts of.</p>
            <p>Hereby alſo I have an opportunity o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly to acknowledg my great obligations to you, and beſeech you to receive this as a Teſtimony of my Gratitude for the many and undeſerved civilities with which you have treated me, which if you pleaſe to do, I ſhall ever own it an high favour to him, that hath the greateſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to Subſcribe himſelf,</p>

            <p>
               <hi>WHat Entertainment the following Diſcourſe will find with Two ſorts of Men, is no hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to foretell: They will Caſt all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and Reproach they can upon It, and the Author; Muſter up all the Calumnies and Slanders, Attaque me with all the Wrath, Bitterneſs, Clamours, and rude Language, which they that reprove Mens Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours (though for no other end but that they may be perſwaded to reform them) are commonly aſſaulted with. One of the Factions will call me Heretick, the Other Jeſuite or Papiſt at the leaſt; That will be angry and revile me for declaring againſt the Errours of the Church of</hi> Rome: <hi>This will be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged and rail at me for charging ſome of the ſame crimes upon it, eſpecially for</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning <hi>that they admire, and are ſo fond of,</hi> their <hi>beloved</hi> Bill of Excluſion. <hi>But the great Searcher of hearts will, I am ſure, acquit me from both thoſe hateful Imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, becauſe he knows me to be neither He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick nor Papiſt, though I confeſs indeed with St.</hi> Paul, <hi>that</hi> after the way, which
<pb facs="tcp:44080:4"/> they (<hi>of the Church of</hi> Rome) call Hereſy, <hi>and thoſe of the</hi> Seperation <hi>as falſly</hi> call Popery, ſo Worſhip I the God of my Fathers; I am, <hi>that is, of the</hi> Excellent Religion <hi>by</hi> Law Eſtabliſh'd <hi>amongſt us, and by the help of God reſolve to live and die in it, and therefore can be neither He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick, nor Papiſt, and ſhall laugh rather than be troubled at them that call me either. Though I have given neither of the</hi> Factions <hi>juſt cauſe to call me ſo, becauſe I have done them no wrong, but fairely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented their Opinions, and faithfully ſhew'd them their Errours, that (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes men calling themſelves Catholicks and Chriſtians) they may reform them: and therefore they ought rather to thank me for my charity than be angry with me: They are to be blamed for running into ſuch Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, and doing ſuch evil things, not I for proving them ſo to be.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>If</hi> Rome <hi>be a dangerous Church for men to venture ſuch a Treaſure as their Souls in, I did not make it ſo, but only call upon all that pleaſe to read me, to chuſe a ſafer, that they may be ſure to obtain that Immortal glory and happineſs, the hope of which is the great joy of our Life, and our only comfort and ſupport when we are to dye, and the enjoyment of it ſo deſireable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable
<pb facs="tcp:44080:4"/> a good, that none but the moſt fooliſh, and the moſt faithleſs men can be careleſs and unconcern'd about it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And if the</hi> Bill <hi>of</hi> Excluſion <hi>be</hi> unjuſt, <hi>&amp; therefore</hi> contrary <hi>to the Excellent</hi> Laws <hi>of</hi> Chriſt, <hi>the</hi> Authors, Promoters, <hi>and</hi> Admirers <hi>of it are to be</hi> blamed <hi>for fixing upon ſuch a</hi> ſinful Expedient, <hi>not I for proving it ſo to be. That God who hath done it hitherto, is ſtill able to protect our Gracious King, and Excellent Religion from the deſignes of all their Enemies, and it is mine (and every good mans) daily Prayers, he will be pleaſed to do it. Why then ſhould any ſo far diſtruſt his goodneſs, as to do an unworthy thing to ſecure them, which are as ſafe already under the ſhadow of his protection, as they can poſſibly be? And if this</hi> Project <hi>of</hi> Excluding <hi>his</hi> Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs <hi>be</hi> unjuſt, <hi>as I ſuppoſe I have</hi> proved <hi>it, if it were put in practiſe it would rather deprive them of the ſafety they have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, than procure them any more, this being to renounce the Providence and the Defence of the Almighty, which are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dear'd and aſſured by Righteouſneſs, and to make Sin our Refuge, which as he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids, ſo it muſt needs highly provoke him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>For my part, I bear no hatred nor ill will to the perſons in either of the Factions, but
<pb facs="tcp:44080:5"/> wiſh them all happineſs, and ſhew them the way to obtain it, that is, by renouncing their Errours, and all thoſe Practiſes, that are therefore Dangerous, becauſe Contrary to ſound Doctrine and common Honeſty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nor was it an itch after vain glory, or a deſire to be in Print that prompted me to write this Diſcourſe; I had no ſuch mean inducements in my thoughts, when I reſolv'd upon this Subject, for if that had been my deſign, I could have choſe one leſs obnoxious to cenſure and miſunderſtanding.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>The Truth is, I ſaw the</hi> King endanger'd for refuſing to paſs <hi>this unjuſt</hi> Bill, <hi>the Kingdom miſerably divided and Diſtracted about it: I perceiv'd it to be a</hi> bone <hi>of Contention, becauſe there was ſo much ſnar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling about it, and was very apprehenſive of the dreadful conſequences of it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I thought my ſelf obliged to contribute my endeavours to undeceive the People, by ſhewing them the Evil and Injuſtice of it; it being the duty of every good Subject to bring Water to quench the Flames of Sedition and Contention, which this Device had kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: And I had, as I apprehended, great encouragement, and weighty reaſons to prompt me to undertake this Subject. The firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe</hi> The Right Honourable the Houſe of Lords caſt out the <hi>Bill</hi> as an abominable
<pb facs="tcp:44080:5"/> thing, and all the Loyal Gentry had pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly proteſted againſt, and declared their abhorrence of it, <hi>and indeed all of the</hi> Church <hi>of</hi> England <hi>that I converſe with (though they heartily abhor, and pray a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Popery) did freely own their great diſlike and hatred of it, which ſatisfi'd me that it was not my ſingular Opinion, that it is unjuſt, but that I had therein the ſuffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and conſent of all good men. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons too that moved me to it were weighty, which are theſe.</hi>

               <hi>Theſe are the</hi> reaſons <hi>that moved me to undertake this Subject, and are ſufficient in my apprehenſion to juſtifie the doing of it; ſo that if any blame me for it, I ſhall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer them in the words of</hi> David <hi>to his pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh Brethren,</hi> VVhat have I now done?

<pb facs="tcp:44080:6"/> intend it: And as for the cenſures of all that are otherwiſe, I ſcorn and think them below my notice or obſervation, let them cenſure me as they pleaſe, I ſhall never trouble my ſelf about them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>All that can require an Apology, is that which I am very apprehenſive of, that I have wrong'd this great Argument by my low and unskilful manage of it. I wiſh with all my heart I could have done it better, it being in my apprehenſion a Caſe of very great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and concern, though I muſt ſay, it was my endeavour to ſpeak reaſon in the caſe, and I hope what I have done will find ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance with all good men, and conduce to the great ends I deſign'd it for.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And ſeeing we all call our ſelves Chriſts Servants and Diſciples, I thought it the faireſt and moſt equal way to compare this ſo much admired</hi> Expedient <hi>with ſome of the prime Laws of Chriſtianity, by which we ſhall all be judged at the laſt day, and have made it appear (I think) to be an open defiance and contradiction to them, and therefore not to be done by a Nation profeſſing his moſt juſt and merciful Religion, which commands us to do</hi> good to all men, <hi>and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury to none.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That which may be thought by ſome a great omiſſion, is, that I have not conſider'd
<pb facs="tcp:44080:7"/> that which is alledg'd in the beginning of the</hi> Bill, <hi>as the prime Reaſon ef their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to</hi> Exclude <hi>his Royal Highneſs, That by his turning Papiſt great encouragement hath been given to the Popiſh Party to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire the Deſtruction of the King, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and the Extirpation of the True Proteſtant Religion. This indeed I ſaid no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to, not becauſe it is unanſwerable, but in truth becauſe I thought it deſerv'd no Anſwer: for unleſs they can prove he turned Papiſt with that intention, their ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king encouragement from it to conſpire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the King, doth not involve the Duke in their guilt, nor make him juſtly puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, becauſe Wicked and Trayterous People are glad of any occaſion to do miſchief, and encourage themſelves to attempt it when no motive or inducement is offer'd them, and it is moſt unreaſonable as well as unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to believe he had any ſuch intention: unreaſonable becauſe no Prince will be a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelite to that which he believes to be a Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous Church, This being to put himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of his Enemies, and to run wilfully upon his own Deſtruction. If his Royal Highneſs be of the</hi> Romiſh <hi>Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (which I do not believe) to be ſure he thinks it an holy and a loyal Church, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that perſwaſion joyn'd himſelf to it: If ſo? he could not poſſibly intend to encourage
<pb facs="tcp:44080:7"/> that Faction to attempt the Kings Life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he believed them honeſt and loyal Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that heartily abhor'd ſuch wicked and cruel practices: but if he was deceiv'd in his Opinion of them, and thoſe whom he thought to be Sheep, be Wolves, ravening and blood-thirſty People, and thoſe whom he took to be Saints, be really Devils, this is their crime, not his, and therefore he is not anſwerable for it, and to puniſh him with the ſeverity the</hi> Excluders <hi>deſign'd upon this ſuppoſal, is the moſt execrable Injuſtice, becauſe it is to puniſh him for other mens Crimes, to deprive him of his Birth-right, becauſe the Zealots of the Church he is of, are (though he neither knew nor believed them ſo to be) Trayterous and Cruel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>This will appear more plainly and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincingly to ſome, if we put the caſe thus; ſuppoſe the next Heir to the Crown, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theirs to be the beſt and pureſt Religion, and ſuch as would conduct him moſt ſafely to eternal Glory and Happineſs, ſhould turn Fanatick, and that Faction Encouraged by his being their Proſelyte, ſhould Conſpire the Death of the King, and the Deſtruction of the Church, which horrid Conſpiracy being by the goodneſs of God diſcover'd, the Church party to preſerve the King, their Religion, their Lives and Eſtates from the Rapine,
<pb facs="tcp:44080:8"/> Oppreſſion, and Cruelty, of that Faction, ſlighting all other means of ſafety, ſhould reſolve upon this as the only ſure</hi> Expedient <hi>for that end, to</hi> Exclude <hi>the Fanatick Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor: In this Caſe he by becoming their Convert intended only to ſave his Soul, or go the right way to Heaven, but the wicked Faction (thinking they ſhould never have ſuch an opportunity again to ſet up their Diſcipline and way of Worſhip) took en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement (though he meant to give them none) from his joyning himſelf to them, to Plot the Death of the King, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Church. I demand then, if it would be juſt for this reaſon to</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude <hi>this Prince? How would the Faction take it? Would not their mouthes be Open'd and their pens Sharpen'd againſt the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors and Promoters of ſuch a</hi> Bill of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion? <hi>Would they not Fill Heaven and Earth with complaints and cries againſt ſuch Injuſtice, and Injury done to a Prince of their Perſwaſion? no doubt they would! why then do they offer that hard meaſure to a Prince of another, that they would not have done to one of their own Church? For if it be unjuſt to</hi> Exclude <hi>the Fanatick, it muſt be equally ſo, to Diſinherit the Popiſh Succeſſor, becauſe he no more intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by turning Papiſt to encourage his Party
<pb facs="tcp:44080:8"/> to Conſpire againſt the King, than the other by turning Fanatick deſign'd to animate his Party to the like wicked attempt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>So that to</hi> Exclude <hi>his Royal Highneſs for this reaſon, becauſe his being (as they ſuppoſe) a Papiſt, hath encouraged the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts to conſpire the deſtruction of our King and Church, is moſt unjuſt, becauſe (as I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd before) it is to puniſh (and that moſt ſeverely) the Innocent for the Guilty, to ruin one man for the Sins of others: For that he intended by turning Papiſt (if he be ſo) to encourage that Faction to attempt ſuch execrable things, as it cannot be proved (becauſe 'tis known to none but the great ſearcher of Hearts) ſo it is the higheſt and moſt horrid uncharitableneſs to ſuppoſe that the Duke in defiance to God, common Honeſty, natural Affection, every thing that is Great, Good, and Juſt, ſhould turn Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt on purpoſe to prompt and exite that Faction to murder his Royal Brother, that he might Fill his Throne. They that har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour ſuch black thoughts of a Prince ſo Juſt in all his other actions, and ſo great a lover of the King as he is known to be, muſt needs be odious to God, his Angels and Saints in Heaven, and to all good Men upon Earth, and without ſuch a purpoſe or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, their taking Encouragement from
<pb facs="tcp:44080:9"/> his being a Convert to their Church, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire the Deſtruction of the King, and our Religion, doth not, cannot make him juſtly puniſhable.</hi>

               </gap> firſt Act of their mind upon the apprehenſion of it, is to decree and determine that it muſt be avoided; this is ſo great an evil that we cannot bear it, if it comes we are undone, it doth certainly bring ruine and deſtruction along with it; therefore we muſt, and will (if it be poſſible) prevent, or ſtay its approach, block up all the avenues and ways by which it may make its paſſage to us. Whilſt they thus reſolve, every thing that offers it ſelf as a means of ſafety, and comes with fair pretences of ſecurity, is welcome, and receiv'd with all expreſſions of love and joy, they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud and hug it as their Friend and Deliverer, and their minds are ſo pleaſed &amp; tranſported with it, that they are not at leiſure to conſider whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be juſt and lawful, whether God and his law allow them to preſerve themſelves by ſuch means; to enquire, whether the ſafety it offers them at preſent, be not attended with more, and greater dangers hereafter: Whether that which they reſolve upon as a means to ſave them now, be not inconſiſtent with their eternal happineſs, and ſuch as will ruine, or deſtroy them for ever.</p>
            <p>For if either Reaſon, or Religion might be heard, they would ſatisfie and convince men, what a wild attempt it is to decline temporal dangers by ſuch ways as lead to eternal miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; to make uſe of ſuch Arts to ſave them from ſuffering here, as will expoſe them to the wrath and vengeance of God hereafter; that no evil, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, or wicked thing is to be done, though accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the rules of humane policy it might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:44080:10"/> and ſecure us at preſent, becauſe it is of infinite hazard to our Souls, and will be their eternal undoing.</p>
            <p>When we can by fair and innocent ways pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for our ſafety, we are unjuſt to our ſelves if we do it not, but when theſe fail, and we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to a ſad neceſſity either to Sin, or Suffer, if we chuſe rather to ſin then ſuffer, we are prophane and wicked, have no Religion nor Fear of God.</p>
            <p>But in great dangers there is no room for ſuch thoughts or conſiderations as theſe, but every thing (by ſome People) is accounted good and lawful, or however, excuſable, that promiſeth ſafety and ſecurity, and when their Religion, their Lives, and Eſtates either are (or are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended) to be endanger'd, they hope God will not be extream to mark what they do amiſs for the ſafegard and defence of them.</p>
            <p>Theſe ſeem to be the ſentiments or opinions of the Authors and Promoters of the <hi>Bill of Exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> otherwiſe they would never have fix'd upon this as the only <hi>Expedient</hi> to obviate and diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point the black and bloody deſign of the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> An <hi>Expedient</hi> ſo highly and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently unjuſt, ſo diſhonourable and reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to our Religion, that tended to blaſt and brand it with eternal infamy, and make it the ſcorn of all the wiſe and honeſt world. Bleſſed God! Whither do pale and gaſtly fears, and blind or furious zeal hurry Men? Had not our Nation incurr'd ſhame and contempt enough from Men, as well as the dreadful diſpleaſure of God, by the barbarous murder and untimely fall of that incomparable Prince, King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, who was depoſed, and murdered, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:44080:11"/> hurryed to an haſty grave by the Fears, Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, and Suſpicions of Popery, which the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of his Royal Vertues and Greatneſs buzz'd into the ears and minds of his People? For what moved them to leave their quiet dwellings? to loath the peace and plenty they injoy'd? What drew them into the field of War, but Fear of, and Zeal againſt Popery? They were told by thoſe, who they thought would not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them, that the King was turning Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt, that the Queen ruled all, that moſt of the Miniſters of State, and the great Men at Court were Popiſhly affected and waited for a change, and if they let them alone the <hi>Romans</hi> would come and take away their Place and Nation. An accuſation, though as falſe as the Devil, and ſuch as had nothing to colour, or make it ſeem probable, yet all that wiſe and good Prince could do to confute the ſlander, to wipe off ſuch an odious and lying imputation, all his excellent declarations, ſhewing his High Eſteem, his Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Affection, his Prudent Zeal for the Proteſtant Religion; his frequent and learned diſputations with ſome of the moſt Eminent Papiſts, who (to their aſtoniſhment) found themſelves ſilenced and confuted by him, and unable to defend their Church againſt the mighty and convincing Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with which this incomparable diſputant ſhattered and beat it down; not his ſolemn pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation before a great concourſe of People at his receiving the moſt Bleſſed Sacrament, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing elſe he could either ſay or do, could clear him from the ſuſpicion of Popery, or ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie Multitudes of his People that he was not gone off from the Reformed Religion; but ſo deep
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:44080:11"/> root had the calumny took in their hearts, that they perſiſted in the belief of it, and that excited their rage, and ſo inflamed their zeal, that in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance to God and his Law they offer'd themſelves as freely to fight for the Faith, as the Chriſtians did in the Primitive times to ſuffer Martyrdom for it, and would not lay down their <hi>Rebellious</hi> and <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian Arms</hi> till they had beat him in the Field, ſeiz'd his Royal Perſon, and by the Mockery of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice condemned him to die: But when they heard him in his laſt words and dying ſpeech profeſs and declare himſelf a Proteſtant (that being no time to diſſemble either with God or the World) then (tho too late) all of them that had any remains of hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, or fear of God, perceiv'd their errour, and ſaid in the bitterneſs of their Souls, what have we done? How have we been cheated into Rebellion by Fears Jealouſies and Rumours of Popery, &amp; ſtain'd our impious hands with <hi>Royal</hi> and <hi>Innocent Bloud?</hi> Wicked men, Sons of <hi>Belial,</hi> have blaſphemed, and ſlandered the Lords Anointed, accuſed him to us as a Papiſt, and an enemy of the true Religion, and we were ſo wicked and credulous as to believe them, and contribute our accurſed endeavours to depoſe and deſtroy him.</p>
            <p>After ſuch an horrid crime, and tremendous wickedneſs as this, had rendred our Nation and Religion odious and contemptible to the World, and we had endeavoured to make ſome repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for it, by our impatient deſires and longings for the return of our preſent moſt Gracious So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign, by Congratulating his arrival with the loudeſt acclamations and expreſſions of joy, by doing juſtice upon thoſe execrable wretches that were the prime actors in that black Tragedy,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:44080:12"/> and with ſolemn penitence beg'd Pardon of, and reconcil'd our ſelves to God, ſo that hereby we began to recover our loſt honour, and the good opinion of our neighbour Nations: After all this, I ſay, to return to our vomit again, to be ſo frighted out of our Wits and our Religion, by the news of Popery, and the diſcovery of the Curſed and Cruel deſign of the Papiſts to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy our King and Church, as to overlook and deſpiſe all lawful means of ſafety, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve upon a wicked and barbarous <hi>Bill of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion,</hi> as the only <hi>Preſervative,</hi> or <hi>Expedient</hi> to ſave them? What is this but to rave, and be mad again? To brand our ſelves with new Infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my and Reproach? To proclaim the Injuſtice and Impiety of our Nation? To draw the eyes, and curſes, and Arms of all the Chriſtian World up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us? Nay to defie Heaven it ſelf, and all the Thunder Bolts of the Almighty, or as the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt judg confeſs'd of himſelf, <hi>neither to fear God, nor regard Man?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sure this Popery is ſome horrible monſter, a dreadful bugbear, that it can at every turn, thus <hi>fright our Engliſh People out of their Wits,</hi> prompt them to the wildeſt and moſt unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able practices? That the very ſuſpicion of it could exaſperate and inrage them ſo againſt their lawful King, who had the Devotion of an Angel, the Piety and Innocence of a Saint, and more then humane Mercy and Goodneſs, as to bring them to that Impious Reſolution, which the <hi>Jews</hi> took up againſt our Bleſſed Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, <hi>we will not have this man rule over us.</hi> And if not that, yet a probability of his being a Convert to the Romiſh Church, ſhould provoke
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:44080:12"/> our Commons, and ſome few of our Peers in ſo high a degree, as to put them upon <hi>diſinheriting</hi> and <hi>excluding a Son of ſuch a Father,</hi> and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting all the Vertues and Glories of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned Anceſtours, treat him as a publick Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and take from him all poſſibility (as far as a Law could do it) of wearing the Crown that encircled and adorn'd their Wiſe and Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Heads.</p>
            <p>Such premiſes as theſe muſt needs infer one, or or both of theſe concluſions; That Popery is a vile thing, or they exceeding wicked men, that ſeek to prevent, and block up its paſſage to us with ſuch Rampires and Bulwarks of Injuſtice, with the greateſt Wrong, and Robbery, and Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. For my part I am no advocate either for Popery, or them that make ſuch wicked and unchriſtian uſe of it, but renounce and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominate them both. That, 'tis certain, is an evil and impious thing, but yet the fears and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of it, muſt not, ought not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke or inſtigate our People to do any unjuſt or ſinful thing to keep it out, becauſe this is to dread and fly from damnation one way, and to run into it another. But that their hatred of it is moſt juſt, appears from the cauſes of it, which are the Errours and Corruptions of the Romiſh Church in Doctrine and Worſhip, and the intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Rapines, Exactions, and Cruelties of it.</p>
            <p>The Errours and Corruptions of its Doctrine and Worſhip, our People know very well that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> locks up the Holy Scriptures (which contain that moſt precious Treaſure, the words of eternal life) in a forreign language which they do not underſtand, and caſts the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:44080:13"/> greateſt contempt upon them, by denying their ſufficiency and perfection, by inlarging the Faith which they propound, by ſetting up ſuch a way of worſhip as they forbid, and ſay God abhors, and againſt which they denounce the moſt dreadful curſes, and horrible puniſhments; by giving Men Diſpenſations to do what they condemn, and to omit what they require. Theſe, and their other Errours are ſuch an heap of dirt and rubbiſh, as hath made not only our People, but other Nations hate ſo foul a Church, which being often reproved and chidden for it, will not reform or caſt it out of doors, but retains or keeps it as tenaciouſly, as if it were an heap of Silver, or pure Gold. Our People have no mind to worſhip Images, to creep to a Crucifix, to pray to Saints that can neither hear, nor help them, to kiſs and fall down to their mouldy Reliques, nor to adore a conſecrated Wafer, but would fain (that they may pleaſe God, and ſave their Souls) keep themſelves from Idols, believe, and live, and worſhip their Creator, as he commands them in the Holy Scriptures, and therefore they abominate the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe it would not allow them (if they were Members of it) ſo to do, but would force them to make ſhipwrack of Faith, and a good Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and that which is the reſult of theſe, Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Happineſs and Salvation.</p>
            <p>The other things that diſguſt our People, and render them ſuch implacable enemies to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Church, are its intolerable Rapines, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions, and Cruelties. Our People are not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant (nor is it poſſible they ſhould, ſo long as we have ſo many Records and Hiſtories relating
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:44080:13"/> them) what ſpoil and havock the Romiſh Clergy made of the Eſtates of their Forefathers, cheated them of their Money by ſelling them Pardons and Indulgences, by telling them they might be redeemed, if not from Hell, yet from Purgatory (a Priſon of the Popes making, and in a manner as diſconſolate and uneaſy, for the time the poor captives ſtay there, as Hell it ſelf, if they were to be believed) with corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible things as Silver and Gold. How they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted the Treaſure, drain'd away the wealth of the Nation by <hi>Peter Pence,</hi> and Firſt-fruits, and Tenths, and Fees for Diſpenſations, and inveſting Biſhops, and Appeals, and I know not how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other ways; ſo that the Kingdom groan'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their inſatiable avarice, and beg'd of God, and his Anointed to eaſe them of ſuch an intoler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able burthen and oppreſſion, not to ſuffer our Silver <hi>Thames</hi> (as it is called) to be the unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Channel to carry out the Engliſh Treaſure, and caſt it upon the banks of <hi>Tyber,</hi> to ſupport the pride and grandeur of a Forraign Patriarch.</p>
            <p>And indeed, the Flux was ſo violent, that if it had not been ſtop'd in time, it would have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd the Body Politick, have let out the Bloud and Spirits of the Nation, diſcouraged their induſtry, and thereby beggar'd the People, for ſeeing their land devoured by Strangers, and Forreigners reap the fruit of their labours, being forced to ſend great ſums abroad, and haunted continually with lazy Monks and begging Friars at home, the miſerable People had no encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to imploy their time and labour to get Wealth for ſuch Caterpillers to Devour.</p>

            <p>Theſe things have created in our People a mighty averſion to and hatred of Popery, and if their hatred kept within its due bounds, and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it ſelf in juſt and lawful ways, they would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve great honour and commendation for it, but to be ſo inflamed at every diſcovery of any Popiſh Plots or Deſigns, or by the impious frauds and artifices of the Seditious (who are always ſpreading falſe rumours of Popery to do miſchief) as to caſt off the Loyalty, Juſtice, and Honeſty, which our Lord requires of all that profeſs his Religion, this inſtead of haters of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, proves them to be the Enemies of Chriſt, and equal Criminals with the worſt of Papiſts, for every wiſe and good man therefore hates Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, becauſe it prompts the Zealots for it, to do ſuch evil and wicked things as are deſtructive of Salvation, but if Zeal againſt Popery put men upon any ſinful, and therefore damnable Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices, theſe are certainly as bad (if not worſe) then thoſe, and both of them go to the dreadful Regions of eternal miſery and ruin: And how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſome may delude themſelves, they that let their fears of, and zeal againſt Popery, incite
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:44080:16"/> them to any Trayterous or Unjuſt Actions, have really no Religion, or fear of God.</p>
            <p>And yet thoſe Fears and that wild Zeal have had ſuch direful influence upon our People in former times; and what a fright, hurry, and fury the diſcovery of the late Popiſh Plot put them into, to what violent counſels it prompted ſome (I believe) well meaning perſons, and how it animated the Seditious to attempt againſt the Government, are as manifeſt as any thing can be. This alſo put the Houſe of Commons upon <hi>Excluding</hi> his Royal Highneſs, as the only <hi>Expedient</hi> for ſuppreſſing Popery, an <hi>Expedient</hi> ſo much admired and applauded by them, that one or two Diſſolutions could not oblige them to deſiſt, or give it over, but the more it was op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the fonder they were of it, and adhered to it with a moſt firm and immoveable reſolution. And though the King, like a moſt wiſe and juſt Prince, told them the miſchiefs, ſhewed them the evil of it, and let them know how impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it was he ſhould ever give his Royal aſſent to ſo unjuſt a Bill, and to divert them from it, Graciouſly propoſed other <hi>Expedients,</hi> and offer'd to do any thing, that was juſt, they ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to remove their fears of Popery, and ſecure the Eſtabliſh'd Religion, yet nothing elſe would ſatisfie them, but with great Importunity and Reſolution they urged, and ſtood for their <hi>Bill of Excluſion,</hi> thinking to tire out the Royal Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience by their obſtinate adherence to it, and preſuming his neceſſities at long run would force him to yield to it, not caring how they diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd, ſo they could by any means oblige him to paſs it.</p>

               <p>Firſt, Then I affirm, that to deprive any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent perſon of his Right and Property, is unjuſt, and inconſiſtent both with the Laws of our Religion, and the Rules of common Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty, and every man is to be ſo accounted, till he hath committed ſuch a crime or offence as forfeits his Right: This is ſo execrable an injury, that God forbids, right reaſon condemns, and all civiliz'd Nations have, and do, and will ſo long as they continue ſuch, abhor, deteſt, and ſhew their hatred of it by ſevere, and exemplary Puniſhments: This if it be done by private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons is Theft and Robbery, if by Magiſtrates it is Oppreſſion, or perverting of Juſtice.</p>
               <p>In thoſe the crime is ſo great, that theſe muſt puniſh it, otherwiſe they do not anſwer the end of their <hi>Inſtitution,</hi> which is to preſerve the Society over which they preſide, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect and defend all the Regular and Obedient Members of it, and by inflicting exemplary puniſhments upon them, to be a terrour to the injurious, and unjuſt, and the evil doers: In theſe (the Magiſtrates that is) the offence is ſo abominable, as to draw down the horrible curſe, and vengance of God upon their guilty heads; 'tis to violate the truſt, to abuſe the power the great Governour of the World hath committed to them, and conſequently to affront Heaven it ſelf, and ſet it at defyance: Inſtead of Patriots this declares them to be Pyrates and Robbers, Men of no conſcience nor honeſty, who are ſo far from taking the fair and equal rules of Juſtice for the meaſures of their Government, that they
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:44080:17"/> proceed Arbitrarily, and make their will their Law. And the injuſtice is the more Criminal and Flagitious becauſe it is without remedy or helps; for every man by the dictate of Nature, and the Law of ſelf preſervation, is ſufficiently Authoris'd to defend himſelf, as far as he can, from private violence or wrong, if Thieves will venture to aſſault or rob him on the Road, or attempt to break and rifle his Houſe, he needs no Warrant to ſeize or Kill them in his own defence, the violence and injury they offer, is a ſufficient commiſſion to juſtify his repelling, or reſiſting of it.</p>
               <p>But there is no place for this in publick injury and violence, for if the Magiſtrate forgetting God and himſelf, will oppreſs thoſe whom he ſhould protect, and inſtead of guarding and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing, invade their Rights and Properties, they may not, muſt not defend themſelves by force, <note place="margin">Rom. 13. 1, 2.</note> becauſe God hath forbidden it, <hi>There is no Power but of God, the Powers that be, are ordain'd of God; whoſoever therefore reſiſteth the Power, reſiſteth the Ordinance of God, and they that reſiſt ſhall receive to themſelves Damnation:</hi> In this caſe, Prayers and Tears (thoſe now ſo much ſcorn'd and deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Weapons of Chriſtians) are their only Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy: They may complain to God, and ſhew him what wrongs they receive from his Deputies and Vicegerents, and beſeech him to convert or turn them from unrighteouſneſs and oppreſſion, they may bewail their Sins that provoked him to ſet an unjuſt Ruler over them, and reconcile themſelves to him by repentance, but they may not take Arms, nor uſe any violent methods to right themſelves, or caſt off that Load of

But, ſetting that aſide, His Royal Highneſs is at preſent Heir apparent to theſe Kingdoms, there being no other that now appears ſo but he, and he hath the greateſt Right or Property of any Subject in theſe King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms. With us the Crown is Hereditary, nay Immortal, for the Law ſays, <hi>The King never dies, but when he quits his Earthly for an higher</hi> (that is, an Heavenly) <hi>Throne, the next of the Bloud Royal aſcends, and fills the Chair of State.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is ſo certain too, as to need no Proof; if it did, the <hi>Excluders</hi> afford Plenty of it, by at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to take it from him, for if the Duke hath no Right to ſucceed the King, what need is there of a <hi>Bill of Excluſion</hi> to put him by it? The want of that Right is of it ſelf <hi>a ſufficient Excluſion?</hi> What madneſs is it to attempt to take that from him which he hath not, to diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit him, to whom the Inheritance doth not belong? What need they trouble either the King, or themſelves to bar his Claim or Title, if he have none? To make a Law that he ſhall not Reign, is a plain confeſſion that he hath a Right to do it, if he ſurvive his Royal Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, otherwiſe the Law is needleſs, and fights with a meer Chimera or Shadow.</p>
               <p>Beſides, the <hi>Bill of Excluſion</hi> is in its own Nature, and the Intention of the Authors of it, either <hi>a Cautionary and Preventive,</hi> or a <hi>Penal Bill,</hi> or both: <hi>a Cautionary and Preventive

               <p>'Tis an old ſaying, <hi>de minimis non curat Lex,</hi> the Law takes no care about trifles and petty things, but overlooks them as below its notice and concern: But a Crown ſure deſerves to be reckon'd <hi>inter maxima,</hi> amongſt them that are greateſt and moſt precious, and that Law that takes no care to ſecure it to the Right owner, much more that would Rob, or deprive him of it, ought to be abhorr'd and branded as <hi>ſumma injuria,</hi> the higheſt Injury, 'tis not properly a Law, but Impudent Tyranny and Oppreſſion,

               <p>Were Tyrants only ſubject to the Clamours and Mutinies of the People, their miſgovern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment might juſtly be accounted the Sole cauſe of them, but ſeeing the beſt, the moſt juſt, and mercyful Princes are equally aſſaulted by them, it can be nothing but Envey or Ambition that prompts the chief Rebels and leading Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineers to enterpriſe againſt them.

               <p>There is nothing, which they that are ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in it, uſe to adhere to, with a more firm, ſtable, and immoveable Reſolution, than the Religion in which they have been educated

               </p>
               <p>They therefore that ſay, the Duke hath changed his Religion, reconciled himſelf (as they call it) to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> muſt ſay
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:44080:26"/> he did it either with Reaſon, or without; that he had great and conſiderable motives to induce him to it, or he had not.</p>

               <p>If they ſay his Royal Highneſs had reaſon for this change, conſiderable motives to induce him to it, theſe muſt be, either his Intereſt and Advantage in this World, or his Salvation in the other, becauſe theſe are the greateſt, and moſt momentous reaſons that could be offered to move him to ſuch a change: but to turn Papiſt I ſhall prove, is neither for his Intereſt and Advantage here, nor his Happineſs and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation hereafter, both theſe being better ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and provided for by his ſtay in ours, then they can be by joyning himſelf to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>

               <p>To make two ſuch (as they of the Church of
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:44080:28"/> 
                  <hi>Rome</hi> do) in every Kingdom, one to ſuperin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Affairs of Religion, the other, Civil Rights, or Matters of State; beſides that it is impudently and faucily to divide and ſeparate the Powers that God hath joyn'd together, Kings and inferiour Magiſtrates (as the Apoſtle exhorts) being to be pray'd for, <hi>That we may lead quiet and peaceable Lives in all Godlineſs and Honeſty,</hi> but how abſurd is it that we ſhould pray to God, they may do that (which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Doctrine of the Romiſh Church) they have no Commiſſion, nor Authority from him to meddle in, that is, to provide that their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects may lead <hi>quiet and peaceable Lives in all Godlineſs, as well as Honeſty,</hi> to take care that their People not only deal Juſtly one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but alſo Worſhip God aright, profeſs the true Faith, and the Holy Religion of Chriſt, and be taught to lead their Lives according to it: Beſides, I ſay, the guilt of dividing the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers that God hath conjoyn'd or united, it is the very dregs of contradiction to make two <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preams</hi> in one Kingdom, for how can one be <hi>Summus</hi> or <hi>Supremus,</hi> the chief or higheſt, if the other be equal to him, 'tis as evident as the Sun when it ſhines brighteſt, that theſe are inconſiſtent, one cannot be the greateſt, if the other be as great, nor one the higheſt, if the other be as high; and therefore to give the Pope a Supream Power in all the concerns of Religion, is (however it may be colour'd or guilded over) to make the Prince his Slave, to give him not an equal, but a ſubordinate and dependent Authority, for he that Rules Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:44080:28"/> muſt needs Rule all, and therefore the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertors of the Popes Supremacy, as they give him a direct and abſolute Power in Spirituals, ſo they give him an indirect and relative Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in Temporals, in order to Spiritual, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious concerns, when the Intereſt of Religion requires it, he may Exerciſe a Temporal Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or Juriſdiction over Princes, Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate or Depoſe them, give their Kingdoms to others, abſolve their Subjects from their Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance, give them Commiſſion, or Warrant to take Arms againſt them, nay to Murder or Deſtroy them: So that the Pope (where he hath the Supremacy) is really the Kings Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and abſolute Lord over him, his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is but precarious, during the pleaſure of his Holineſs; for ſo long as he behaves himſelf humbly, and dutifully towards his Holy, or Spiritual Father, Executes all his orders, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves all his injunctions, though never ſo bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous, bloudy, and inhumane, ſo long he ſhall have his Bleſſing, and injoy his Favour: and being ſo dependent, he muſt needs have a tottering Throne, and an uncertain Authority, the Crown ſits looſly on his Royal Head, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy at every turn to drop or fall off: If he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute the Commands of his great Maſter (the Pope) complain of his Exactions, remonſtrate againſt any of his proceedings, though never ſo modeſtly, if he expreſs any ſorrow for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable oppreſſions of his People, if he be unwilling to Butcher, and Cut their Throats like Sacrificed Beaſts, or to make Bonefires of Innocent and harmleſs Men, meerly for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:44080:29"/> the True Faith, and obeying the Holy Religion of Chriſt. If the Divine Goodneſs be pleas'd to inlighten his Royal Soul with the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of the Truth, and by the ſplendour of that Light he ſee, and condemn the errours and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of the Romiſh Church, then he is an Heretick, and they ſay of him as the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Zealots did concerning St. <hi>Paul, Away with ſuch a Prince from the Earth, for it is not fit that he ſhould Live, Excommunicate, curſe him with Bell, Book, and Candle:</hi> then it is meritorious to kill him, and his Holineſs hath a <hi>Ravilliack,</hi> or a <hi>Jaques Clement,</hi> or ſome ſuch Villain to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſſinate, or murder him, wholf he effect the execrable Parricide, ſhall be well rewarded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth, or if he Periſh in the attempt, be made (as far as the Pope can do it) a Saint in Heaven.</p>
               <p>Conſider then what Charms or Allurements ſuch a Church can have to invite a Prince into its Communion? Theſe certainly are ſo far from being attractives, that they are the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt diſſwaſives imaginable, and inſtead of draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to, muſt needs deter, and drive him from it? A Prince that knows and hath had Communion with a better, muſt firſt run out of his Wits, before he can joyn himſelf to ſuch a Church: A Church, in which he cannot aſcend his Royal Throne without a Rival! a Rival, did I ſay, nay a moſt imperious Maſter, that is very hard to pleaſe, and yet if he be not pleaſed and humour'd in all things, 'tis a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand to one but he will joſtle him out of it, and lay his Honour in the duſt: A Church, in
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:44080:29"/> which he can Exerciſe but a part, and that the meaneſt, and moſt ignoble part of his Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that only which concerns the Civil Polity and Rights; for he may not meddle with Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion nor the Miniſters of it, who are exempt from his Juriſdiction, and Sworn Vaſſals to his Superiour, and as ſuch ready to revenge the Injuries and Affronts the Prince offers to their great Maſters, if he dares be ſo raſh, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adviſed as to be guilty of any; but of that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. A Church, in which he that is Gods Image and Repreſentative, leſs only then God, muſt ſneak and truckle Meanly to an Upſtart and U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurper, a meteor drawn from the Earth, and raiſed on high by Pride, Avarice, and Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty.</p>
               <p>What Temptation then could his Royal Highneſs, who is a wiſe Prince, of a brave and generous Spirit, and ſo exceeding tender of his Honour, that he muſt needs in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt manner reſent the leaſt Violation of his Right, all diminution or leſſening of his Power, all invaſion and uſurpation of the Priviledges and Prerogatives belonging to it, both by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and Humane Right, if the Crown ſhould deſcend to him? What Temptation, I ſay, could ſuch a Prince have to joyn himſelf to a Church in which he ſhall be ſo degraded and diſhonour'd, be a Vaſſal &amp; Underling to one that unjuſtly, inſolently, and prophanely exalts himſelf above all that is called God, that is, all the Kings of the Earth? Eſpecially if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that the Church he forſakes or goes from,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:44080:30"/> Courts his ſtay by giving her Kings their full Authority, all the Priviledges, Prerogatives and Preheminences belonging to them: in this (that is, the Church of <hi>England</hi>) the King is declared Supream not only in Temporal, but in all Cauſes Eccleſiaſtical, ſuperintends Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as well as Civil Rights, governs the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, chuſes the Biſhops, convenes them when he ſees cauſe, to make Canons, &amp; Conſtitutions, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſes &amp; Impowers them to conſult, &amp; debate, to order &amp; conduct the Circumſtances of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (the Eſſentials of it being determined by God in Scripture) &amp; what they agree upon, he doth at their humble Petition (if he approve of them) by his Royal Edict, confirm, or paſs into Laws Eccleſiaſtical, and when they have effected what he called them together for, he diſmiſſes or diſſolves the aſſembly. Here the Kings Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er within his Realms and Dominions, is affirm'd, and declared to be <hi>the Higheſt Power under God,</hi>

               <p>And if any of our Clergy, or Laity dare to impugn, or oppoſe the Royal Supremacy, they are Anathematiz'd, or decreed to be Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated, which is the greateſt Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Church can inflict, and the moſt dreadful one any Man can ſuffer in this World.</p>
               <p>'Tis moſt apparent then that our Church gives and ſecures to the Crown that great, and moſt precious Jewel, the Supremacy, which is the chief Glory and Ornament of it, which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſo unjuſtly ſteals from and Robs it of: Here the Prince hath no Rival nor Competitor, none to inſult or Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineer over him, as in the Romiſh Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, no Lord at all over him, but the great Governour of all the World, God Almighty, to whom it is his Glory, as well as Duty to be Subject, and ſubmit himſelf in all things.</p>

               <p>What Motives or Inducements then could his Royal Highneſs have to forſake ſuch a Church as this? A Church that is ſo tender of the Honour of her Princes, ſo zealouſly aſſerts, maintains, and defends their Royal Authority, all their Rights, Priviledges, and Prerogatives, gives them no offence at all, is in nothing inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to them, but next to the great Giver of Crowns, the Glorious Founder of their Order; Honours, Reveres, and Obeys them.</p>
               <p>'Tis apparently the Dukes Intereſt to ſtay in this Holy and Loyal Church, to lend his help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hand to preſerve, ſupport, and defend it from all its Enemies, as his Renowned Grand-Father, his Immortal and moſt Glorious Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did ſo carefully in their Days, and his

               <p>'Tis no wonder, if a Prince that knows no better, truckles to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> bears all the burthens, injuries, and oppreſſions it lays upon him, is content the Pope ſhould Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineer, or Lord it over him, ſneaks, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haves himſelf as ſubmiſly to him, as if he was the meaneſt of his Domeſtick Servants, his Groom, or Stirrup-holder, as ſome Princes have been, his ignorance is the Mother of this Spaniſh ſlaviſh Obedience, and Devotion: but there is no place for this in his Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, he hath heard enough of the Inſolencies, Incroachments, and Miſdemeanours, the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, Cruelties, and Outrages, which the Pope and thoſe of his Faction have committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Kings, he was Born and Educated in a Church that abominates, deteſts, and declaims againſt ſuch Impious and Unchriſtian Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; that Teaches all its Members, and People to <hi>Fear God and the King, and not meddle with them that are given to change,</hi> and therefore cannot be ſo unmindful of his Honour, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt as to make ſo unreaſonable a change, to quit the Brave and Glorious Freedom of ours, for the baſe and reproachful Vaſſalage, or Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the firſt part of a Princes happineſs in this World, to injoy all the Authority, Priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and Prerogatives belonging to his Royal Dignity, which I have proved he may do in

Which is to invert or turn the Ordinance of our Lord upſide down: You are deceiv'd, ye Charitable Souls, that think to bring the Diſſenters into the Church, by caſting the Ceremonies they except againſt, out of it, 'tis not that; but the Preheminence and Superiority they contend for, they would be uppermoſt, Rule all both in Church and State, this is the point they would gain, for this they whine and wrangle, ſtir up ſtrife and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:44080:40"/> Sedition, Plot Treaſon from Age to Age, from Generation to Generation, for this they make Schiſms, and ſet up new Churches, and ſcare the People from the Old, by declaiming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Ceremonies, and crying cut of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Prayers, Veſtments, Rites, and Biſhops, and bawling upon every Occaſion (as if they would tear their Throats) <hi>Popery, Popery:</hi> 'Tis not Conſcience, but Intereſt that puts them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe extravagant courſes, they are not ſo ſilly (I mean the leading Men amongſt them) as to believe it a Sin to Communicate with our Church in all the parts of its Worſhip, though they are ſuch Knaves as to tell the People ſo, that they may draw them from it, and having got a party ſtrong enough, deſtroy the Church, and with it the Monarchy, that they may Reign as Kings, and injoy their ſo much cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Empire and Soveraignity: Wipe off the Paint and Varniſh, the Colours and pretences with which they endeavour to cover and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal it, till a fit Opportunity, and every Eye (that is willing to ſee) may diſcern this to be the great Deſign they are Ingaged in.</p>
               <p>Another Expedient I find tender'd by a Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table hand for reducing the ſtraglers to the Church, is <hi>Inſtruction,</hi> that they be ſhew'd the Innocent and Lawfulneſs of the things they ſcruple in our Church, and that they be fully Explicated, as alſo the Sinfulneſs of their Schiſm, or Separation from it, together with the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous and dangerous conſequences of it: This is a good way indeed, but then the queſtion is
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:44080:40"/> how it ſhall be put in Practice: I know but theſe three ways, Preaching, Writing, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences: Preaching cannot do it, becauſe they will not hear our Clergy, 'tis a rare thing to ſee any of the Diſſenters come to our Pariſh Churches, when they may ſafely go to their own Meeting Houſes, or if any of them be pleas'd at any time to come, if the Sermon tend to juſtifie the Conſtitutions of the Church, to refute the Cavils and Objections that are made againſt them, to reprove though with all Gentleneſs, and the ſofteſt words, the Sin, and Errour of thoſe that ſeparate from it, they are ſad, nay angry at ſuch ſayings, go away high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly provoked, and offended, and will not be ſo civil as to hear the Preacher out: And as Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cannot, unleſs they be forced to hear, and the juſt Correction of the Laws drive them from their Conventicles, to our Aſſemblies; ſo Writing hath done no good upon them, all the excellent Books that have been written both formerly and of late Years by the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Divines of our Church, in which all their exceptions againſt it have been fully anſwer'd, all their ſcruples ſatisfi'd, all their Pleas and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologies for their Separation throughly confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the Authors of them put to all the ſhame and ſilence Men of their Confidence are capable of, yet they are never the better, but perſiſt ſtubbornly in their wicked Schiſm, and prove to all the World that they are ſuch as hate to be Reformed, the crafty ſeducers tell their Credulous followers, that ſuch are Lewd and ungodly Books, and that frights them ſo, that they dare not upon any Terms give them
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:44080:41"/> the Reading; all that their guides think fit to do in the caſe, is to imploy ſome Pragmatical Fellow to write an Anſwer, which, how ſilly or impertinent ſoever, is admired and applaud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the whole Faction as an Incomparable piece, and the Author hugd and careſs'd by the Brethren, and Holy Siſters as a very precious Man.</p>
               <p>Nor can any better ſucceſs be reaſonably expected from the other way, that of Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, becauſe if they will not hear our Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy Preach, nor Read the excellent Books they have writ in defence of the Church, they will be as averſe (eſpecially when they have their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty) to private Conference, be with great difficulty brought to admit the Charitable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that comes to undeceive them, or if they do, they are generally ſo ignorant, and ſo conceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that it is very hard to make them under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the nature of the things diſputed, what Schiſm is, and how exceeding Sinful, and if this be done, they are ſo highly conceited of their own Gifts and Godlineſs, as to think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Wiſer and Holyer than he that offers them Inſtruction: Beſides, they are ſuch Slaves to, ſo wholly at the Command of their own Guides and Teachers, that if they tell them their ſeparate Meetings are Innocent and Holy Aſſemblies, and thoſe of the Church ſo impure, or defiled with Popiſh Prayers, Ceremonies, and other Humane Inventions, that it is not ſafe for them to venture their precious Souls in them, they believe ſuch lying words as firmly, as if they were Divine Truths, and adhere to them in
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:44080:41"/> ſpight of all the Scripture and Reaſon that can be brought againſt them.</p>
               <p>Theſe therefore, and all other vain projects laid aſide; the Government (if it will be ſafe and happy) muſt with great and earneſt care endeavour to reduce them to the Church, which can be effected no other way but by a ſtrict Executing the Laws upon all Diſſenters, &amp; an unwearied perſiſting in it, letting them ſee that if they dare be ſo impudent as to Affront, Tranſgreſs the Laws, and defie Authority, that both will and dares do Juſtice upon ſuch bold Offendors: This in time will make them leave their Fooling (to give it no worſe Title) Teach the People to ſhun the Meeting-Houſes with the ſame caution and waryneſs as they do the Dreadful and Diſconſolate Places, where Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery and Ruin dwell: This will put them upon ſerious Thoughts and Conſiderations, Oblige them ſtrictly to Examine the Cauſe for which they Suffer, prompt them to ask themſelves ſuch queſtions as theſe, what harm or venom is there in the Ceremonies of the Church that we ſhould be ſo affraid of them, as to run from the Communion of it? Do not our own Guides and Teachers confeſs the Doctrine of it to be pure, or agreeable to the Scriptures? Are there not abundance of Learned, Pious, and Holy Men that Live and Dye in the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of it, and can we think that ſuch Men are not Saved? And if they be? Why will not the ſame Faith, the ſame Doctrine, the ſame Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Holyneſs carry us to Heaven? Are not the Doctrine, Government, and Worſhip the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:44080:42"/> ſame that were Taught, exercis'd, and uſed by thoſe brave and Holy Men that with ſuch admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable zeal, and courage ſuffer'd Martyrdom in the Reign of Queen <hi>Mary?</hi> How can that be Popery now, which was practic'd by them, who would rather burn at a Stake then turn Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt, and are we Wiſer, or more Conſcientious than they? The Wiſe Merciful Correction of the Laws will by degrees bring the Offendors to a ſight and abhorring of their Errours, and produce in them ſuch good Thoughts as theſe, and conſequently ingage them to return from whence they are fallen, I mean to our Holy and Excellent Church, which will put an Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py end to all our Schiſms and Diviſions, and the People by coming conſtantly to our Pious Loyal Aſſemblies, will in a little time Learn to <hi>Fear God, and the King, and meddle no more with them that are given to change;</hi> But if this great means of reducing them be waved, or neglected, or coldly proſecuted, ſuch a Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and deſirable Revolution can never be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, but our fewds and contentions will be Immortal, and we ſhall be as the ſcorn of, ſo the moſt Miſerable and Diſtracted Nation in the World.</p>
               <p>Without this nothing can reduce them, but in Conjunction with, and Subordination to it, there are other things that will contribute very much to it, as the <hi>Exemplary Piety, and ſtrict Conformity of the Clergy, and the putting them into ſuch a Condition that they may not depend upon the Benevolence of the People for their Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:44080:42"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Their Exemplary Piety,</hi> that none be ſuffer'd to Diſhonour our moſt pure and holy Church by their Evil and unſuitable Lives, for though 'tis certain we have the moſt Learned, Pious, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blamable, and therefore Excellent Clergy in the World, yet if there be any irregular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons amongſt them (as 'tis poſſible there may, in ſuch a great Body of Men, be here and there one that forgets himſelf) that care be taken, and means uſed to Reform them, that they give no Offence, Miniſter no Occaſion to any to Reproach the Church, or to ſpeak Evil of our moſt Holy and Undefiled Religion: We ſee how cautious and careful the Schiſmatical Preachers are to ſeem Holy, that they may gain the Eſteem and Veneration of the People, and lead them by the Noſes whether, and to what they pleaſe, and if the ſhadow in them, to be ſure the Subſtance of Holineſs, a Vertuous and unblamable Life in all our Clergy, will gain them great Authority with the People, and convince them that muſt needs be an Holy Church, that hath ſo Pious, Regular, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent a Clergy.</p>
               <p>The next is their <hi>ſtrict Conformity,</hi> that all of them be compell'd to obſerve all the Orders, and Conſtitutions of the Church. Unleſs this be done the People can never be drawn off from their prejudices againſt, and miſperſwaſions concerning them, but will think them unlawful Impoſitions; becauſe ſome of the Clergy do not obſerve them, and they will admire, applaud, and follow thoſe that do not obſerve them, as the moſt Moderate, Pious, and Conſcientious

               <p>And ſeeing all the true Members of the Church of <hi>England</hi> are Eminently Loyal alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and thoſe of our People that are otherwiſe at preſent, may in time by theſe means be made ſo, 'tis againſt the Dukes Intereſt and Happineſs, if the Crown devolve upon him to be a Papiſt; becauſe this would be to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change good Subjects for bad, a Loyal People that own no Prince but him, for ſuch as have been guilty of frequent Treaſons, and are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd Subjects to a Forreign Power.</p>
               <p>And next to his own honour, ſafety and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, <note place="margin">Subſect. 3.</note> all that a Prince can deſire in this World is the Welfare and Felicity of his People: And then it is well with any People, and they are happy, when they Live in Piety, and Peace and Safety, are encouraged and required to profeſs and practice the true Religion, and to Worſhip God Aright, that is, according to the the Scriptures: When they are protected in their Eſtates from Rapine and Oppreſſion, and in their Perſons from Violence and Cruelty, Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:44080:45"/> are the People that are in ſuch a Caſe. And it is both the Duty and Glory of the Prince to provide or take Care that this be the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his People or Subjects: His Duty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, this is the great end of Government, and the prime Reaſon of Gods Inveſting him with the Royal Authority: When <hi>David</hi> was <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſalm</hi> 78: 71.</note> choſen by God to be King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>That he took him to feed Jacob his People, and Iſrael his Inheritance:</hi> To ſeed, (that is) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect and preſerve them from miſchief and Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, not to Worry or Devour, to Deſtroy or Hurt, but to Defend them from harm and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. And becauſe he had been ſo to them, and they hoped he would have Lived long to be ſo to them ſtill, they bitterly lamented the Death of good King <hi>Joſiah,</hi> ſaying, <hi>The Breath of our Noſtrils, the Anoynted of the Lord, was</hi>

                  <hi>Evil:</hi> They are not ſo in the purpoſe or inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God, were not inſtituted or ordain'd by him for ſuch an evil, unjuſt, and unworthy end, to Injure, Puniſh, and Deſtroy good Men, they have no ſuch Power from him, and if they do it, they abuſe their Authority, and go beyond their Commiſſion. A Terrour they may and muſt be, but it is not to the good, but to the Evil-doers: <hi>Wilt thou then not be affraid of the Power? Do that which is good, and thou
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:44080:46"/> ſhalt have Praiſe of the ſame, for he is the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of God to thee for good.</hi> The Prince, or Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler is imploy'd by God, to protect and defend the good, and this is, or ought to be the great Deſign or Intention of all his Laws, that they be a ſafeguard and ſecurity to ſuch, and a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour or reſtraint to the Evil and Injurious.</p>
               <p>And if the Prince muſt not ſuffer others to wrong his People, to be ſure it muſt needs be ſinful and unlawful for him to do it: To Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute Thieves and Murderers and yet be Unjuſt and Cruel himſelf. 'Tis true, if he be ſo, his People may not, muſt not revenge the wrongs, nor reſiſt the Violence he offers to them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Apoſtle tells them what the dreadful Puniſhment of that reſiſtance will be, <hi>They that reſiſt ſhall recieve to themſelves Damnation;</hi> And becauſe God is the only Judg of Kings, and he ſo Righteous a Judg, that he will be ſure to Puniſh them, if they abuſe their Power. When <hi>David</hi> was unjuſtly purſued, &amp; Injuriouſly dealt with by King <hi>Saul,</hi> he did not ſtudy Revenge, but abhor'd it, ſaying, <hi>God forbid that I ſhould ſtretch forth mine hand againſt the Lords Anoynted:</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 Sam. 26. 11.</note> He remitted or left him to his proper Judg. <hi>David</hi> ſaid furthermore, <hi>As the Lord Liveth, the Lord ſhall ſmite him, or his Day ſhall come to</hi>

               <p>But the Peoples having no Power from God to Revenge the wrongs done them by their
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:44080:46"/> Prince, is no encouragement for him to do them, becauſe, as they are contrary to his Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and the abuſing his Authority, he is anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and accountable to God for them, and muſt expect from him a Puniſhment equal to them. And that they may Faithfully perform this Duty, conſult and provide for the good and welfare of their People, the Apoſtle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, <hi>that Supplications, and Prayers, and Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions be made for them, for Kings, and all that are in Authority, that we may lead quiet and Peaceable Lives in all Godlineſs, and Honeſty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This, as it is the Princes Duty, ſo his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Glory, when according to the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Title of Kings, he is a Common Father to his People, hath a Paternal care of, and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection for them, Loves them, and is tender of their Lives and Properties, is ſo far from De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying the Innocent, that he is unwilling to Condemn and Execute the Guilty, and would not do it, but that thoſe cannot be ſafe, unleſs theſe be cut off, had rather ſave one Subject than Deſtroy a Thouſand Enemies, and thinks himſelf Rich enough, if his Loyal Subjects be ſo, and inſtead, of Impoveriſhing them by needleſs Wars, encourages Trade, and Studies to keep them in Peace and Plenty.</p>
               <p>'Tis as impoſſible for wiſe and good People not to Love ſuch a Prince, as it is for them to hate themſelves, or not to be concern'd for their own Intereſt. They look upon him as their chief Patron and Benefactor upon Earth, and the Sun it ſelf is not dearer to them, than he is: They Love and hate as he doth, they that are
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:44080:47"/> his Friends they account theirs, and thoſe that are his Enemies, they abhor as if they were their own. They have the higheſt eſteem and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration for him in their Hearts, which they expreſs in their words, and Actions: In their words by filling all Places with his Praiſes, and ſpeaking nothing but Panegyricks and Encomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums of him: In their Actions by treating him with the greateſt reverence and reſpect, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving him in Triumph, and with all poſſible expreſſions of Joy, whereever he comes, as if ſome Glorious Angel was deſcended from the Heavenly Regions, and come to Bleſs them with his preſence: By obeying his Laws, and obſerving all his Royal Injunctions, doing eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing he Commands with a ready, cheerful, and willing Mind. Such a Prince, as he is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd and belov'd in his Life, ſo he is truly La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented at his Death, and his Subjects pay their Tributary Tears at his Royal Sepulchre, weep over him, and ſay as <hi>Eliſha</hi> did at the depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>Elijah, my Father, my Father, the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot of Iſrael, and Horſemen thereof:</hi> And though he be gone to take poſſeſſion of a better King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and to receive a brighter Crown, yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt all his Glorys above, they cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get to Praiſe and Honour him upon Earth; not only think, but call him Bleſſed, raiſe the faireſt Monuments to his Memory, inſcribe his Royal Vertues, and Glorious Actions in never Dying Records, that his Fame and Renown deſcend to after Ages, and all Generations may admire and call him Bleſſed. So that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding or taking care for the welfare of his
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:44080:47"/> People is a conſiderable part of the Princes hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.</p>
               <p>Let us enquire then, if this be not alſo loſt by the Dukes being a Papiſt, if the Crown ſhould deſcend to him.</p>
               <p>If he come to be King, and be of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Religion, he muſt ſet up that, or not: if he do it not, he Fruſtrates their Expectation, diſobliges that Party, and thereby incurs their Rage and Diſpleaſure, which muſt needs be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Fierce and Cruel, becauſe ever ſince Queen <hi>Mary</hi> left the World, it hath been their ſtudy and endeavour to get a Catholick into the Throne.</p>
               <p>This hath coſt them ſo much Labour, put them upon ſo many Conſpiracies, for this ſo many of their Zealots have been Executed, found a worſe Purgatory here, than that they talk ſo much of after this Life: And having gain'd their point, as they thought, got a King of their Religion, for him to be content with Maſs in his own Chappel, and let his People openly profeſs and enjoy the Reformed Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which they call Hereſy, and hate worſe than they do the Devil! What an unpardonable Injury, Affront, and Diſappointment is this? This is to rouſe and irritate the Angry Lyons, to deny the hungry Wolfes the Prey, they have been ſo long hunting after? his Holineſs, though he be Indulgent enough to other Sinners, and ſells them Pardons at as Cheap and Reaſonable Rates, as they can well deſire, hath no Mercy in ſtore for ſuch a Tranſgreſſor: Sons will ſooner pardon thoſe that Kill their Fathers, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:44080:48"/> thoſe that Murder their Innocent Children, &amp; inraged Husbands them that Raviſh their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Wives, than he will forgive ſuch a crime as this: A crime that robs him of his ſo much admired Soveraignty, of his dear, and moſt deſired Profit, of his firſt Fruits, Tenths, <hi>Peter</hi>-pence, Fees for Inveſting Biſhops, Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence Mony, and all his other ways of getting Wealth, by which (as our Hiſtories relate) he drain'd a mighty Treaſure out of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and which if the Prince deny him, his Reign will be ſhort, and his days few, for if the Traiterous Prieſts and Jeſuits that are about him, do not Poyſon or Stab him before their great Maſter hath declared him Unprofitable, &amp; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently unworthy of the Royal Throne, to be ſure he (having firſt for Faſhion ſake Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed and Exhorted him to be Zealous of, and mind the good of the Catholick Cauſe) will proceed to Sentence, Declare him Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of, &amp; faln from all Dominion and Rule, &amp; then every one that Kills him, <hi>thinks he doth God the moſt acceptable Service,</hi> &amp; ſuch as Merits from him the bigeſt reward, and the brighteſt Crown, provided inthe Regions above, for his moſt faithful Servants.</p>
               <p>So that a Popiſh King cannot be ſafe unleſs he ſets up that Religion, he muſt be a Zealous Aſſertor, Promoter, and Maintainer of it, or elſe his own Party will depoſe and lay his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in the Duſt, down he muſt come, (unleſs a ſpecial Providence Guard him) deſcend into his Grave by a violent and untimely Fate, if he do not Imploy all his Power and skill to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance or ſet up that, if he refuſe to do this, he
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:44080:48"/> Ruins and undoes himſelf; for being of that Religion he muſt have ſome of its Prieſts to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Sacred Offices of it, which gives them acceſs to his Perſon, and conſequently Oppertunity to Diſpatch him.</p>
               <p>And therefore if his Royal Highneſs be a Papiſt, and as ſuch, comes to the Crown, by refuſing to ſet up that Religion, he will expoſe himſelf to the fierceſt Rage of that party, and Conſequently to the greateſt Danger, though that rage of theirs will be moſt unreaſonable becauſe unprofitable to them, all the reſt of the Royal Family being known and profeſſed <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> ſo that no advantage can accrue to them by his Depoſition or Death. Beſides 'tis very probable that he may have no fear or Apprehenſion at all of it, for if he be a Convert to that Church, to be ſure he hath a good Oppinion of it, and thinks them honeſt Men, or elſe he would never have joyn'd himſelf to them, and being ſo Perſwaded, how can he appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend any danger from them, if he do not ſet up that Religion, which he agrees with them in their Profeſſion of? He may think he doth the Romiſh Faith Honour enough by the open owning of it, and ſufficient Service, as his Example is a great allurement to invite others to imbrace it, and he may Conſider that to ſet it up by force will produce ſuch Cruelty, and Oppreſſions, let in ſo many Miſeries, that his Clemency and Goodneſs may oblige him to abhor the thoughts of doing it: If it be ſaid that every Man deſires to Propagate and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance his own Religion, and therefore the Duke if he be King will have the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:44080:49"/> to Promote his, I grant it, but then I ſay every Man will not make uſe of unjuſt and cruel Methods for that purpoſe, but endeavour to win Men to it by Arguments and Perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, he will do the Religion he is of all the Right and Service he can, without wronging others, he will by fair and lawful ways gain all the Converts he can to it, but he will not make Sacrifices of thoſe that refuſe it, and no Man knows but this may be the Dukes Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if he come to be King, and be a <hi>Papiſt.</hi> To ſay he will think that God requires him to ſet it up, and that he cannot be Saved unleſs he do it, is to ſay that he will think God requires him to make three Kingdoms Miſerable, to commit many Oppreſſions, Cruelties and Murders, and that ſuch Horrid things as theſe (which God forbids and declares to be Damnable) are neceſſary to his Salvation, which are moſt Unreaſonable for any man, that is truly Religious, to think. If the Duke think the <hi>Roman</hi> to be the true Religion, he will think God requires him to beleive and profeſs it, and to Endeavour by all Lawful means to Convert his People to it, but if thoſe do not Prevail, he muſt in reaſon think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf Obliged no farther, becauſe the uſing cruel, and unlawful means, to that Purpoſe, is Apparently Deſtructive of that Salvation, which he deſigns to obtain by Imbracing that Religion. And being aſſured God will not be Diſpleaſed with him, if he do not ſet it up, becauſe it cannot be done, without doing thoſe things, againſt which his Wrath is revealed from
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:44080:49"/> Heaven, he may either Apprehend no danger from the Profeſſors of it, or if he do, deſpiſe it relying upon the Divine Protection, which his Conſulting the ſafety and welfare of the People is a great Endearment of: For if he ſet up the Romiſh Religion, the People muſt either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come its Proſelytes, or not: If they do, they loſe Heaven: If they do not, they are ſure to be Miſerable upon Earth.</p>
               <p>For Men to profeſs known Errours, and to Practiſe Groſs and known Sins, muſt needs be Damnable, but all Proteſtants know and are Convinced in their Conſciences that the Romiſh Church is guilty of many and great Errours, Sins, and Impietys: Errours in Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, Impieties, (Hainous Impieties) in Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, ſuch are the Images they make of God, and the Divine Honour or Worſhip they give unto them, as alſo their Praying to Saints, Adoring their Images and Reliques, and the Elements in the Euchariſt, with divers other Abominations which they are Guilty of, and therefore for them, that are convinced of the Sinfulneſs of theſe things, to turn to that Church muſt needs be to ſhut themſelves out of the Kingdome of Heaven.</p>
               <p>But if that be too great a good to be ſo parted with, then to ſecure it, they muſt reſolve to undergo all the Miſeries, and Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and Sad things which, upon their refuſing the Romiſh Religion, will break in upon them, for either they muſt fly from the Storm, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come voluntary Exiles, leave their Native Country, their deareſt Friends and Enjoyments,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:44080:50"/> go ſeek their ſafety, and ſome of them, their Maintainance in other Nations: which is a great and ſad Calamity, or elſe ſtay and be Executed as Hereticks at home: And ſeeing theſe will be the Lamentable conſequences of his ſetting up the Romiſh Religion, I deſire thoſe that are ſo forward to believe he will do it, to conſider what advantages can accrue to his Royal Highneſs by ſuch violent and Tragical actions? can it be any Pleaſure to him to hear the Groans of Dying Men, or to ſee the Funeral Piles of them that are Sacrifiz'd for the Faith of Chriſt, Blaze before him. Or can it be for his ſafety to deſtroy many of his beſt and moſt Loyal Subjects, and by the Terrour and Severity of their Sufferings to force others to turn Papiſts? this is to drive them from a Loyal to a Trayterous Church, and how can he expect they ſhould be true to him, whom he Compells to be Unfaithful to their God? Is it for his Honour to Execute the Bloody and Inhumane Sentences of <hi>Rome</hi> upon his good Subjects, to be the Popes Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to commit what Cruelties he pleaſeth in theſe our <hi>Brittiſh Iſlands.</hi> Is not Murder an Hainous Sin? and will not Innocent Blood, the Blood of thoſe, that will be Slain (if Popery be ſet up) for profeſſing the true Faith and Holy Religion of Chriſt, cry aloud to the Righteous God for Vengeance, and Provoke him to puniſh him here with a ſhort Reign, with the Terrours of a guilty Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, with one Plague and Judgment after another, till he paſs from Hence to the other
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:44080:50"/> World, and inſtead of the Glorious Crown the Pope, and his Prieſts, flatterd him with the hopes of, he find an Horrid and Intoler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Ruin.</p>
               <p>Search all Hiſtories, Examine all the Annals of the World, and you will find that of the Philoſopher to be a great truth, <hi>That Tyrants ſeldome live to be Old,</hi> the Saints pray, their Blood and Sufferings cry to Heaven againſt them, and God Abhors, and the Earth Groans under the burthen of their Crimes, and Hell is ready for them. How then can it be for the Dukes Honour or Felicity to be one of them, to live (and that but for a little time) Abhor'd by God, dreaded and forſaken by all good Men, to die Unpityed and Unlamented, to depart this World not with the Tears and Praiſes, but with the Joy and Thanksgivings of his Subjects, that by his Death they are deliver'd from the Miſeries and Oppreſſions his Reign was attended with, to have the ſtory of his Life (there being ſome that delight to Record the Actions of Princes) tranſmitted to future Ages, ſtain'd with ſo many Executions, Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and Oppreſſions, which his ſetting up the Romiſh Religion will occaſion, and to be remembred no otherwiſe when he is Dead and gone, than Plagues, and Wars, and the moſt dreadful Calamities are, that is, with Horrour and Amazment.</p>
               <p>How unreaſonable is it then to believe his Royal Highneſs (if he come to the Crown) will thus ruin and undo himſelf for no Reaſon or Inducement at all: Common Prudence will
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:44080:51"/> not ſuffer him to be ſo much his own Enemy And therefore they that upon idle Rumours, or meer Suſpicions entertain ſuch unbecoming thoughts of him, do great Injury to, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely wrong, ſo brave a Prince, who is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed by his very Enemies to be Highly juſt and hath ventured his Life in defence of his Country, and therefore in reaſon and juſtice ought neither to be accounted, nor treated as its Enemy, that hath any intention to Ruin, if it be the will of Heaven that he Reign over it.</p>
               <p>'Tis certain then, that it is not for the Duke Intereſt in this World to turn Papiſt, and therefore if he be ſo, that cannot be the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of it.</p>
               <p>The only Motive therefore he could have to <note place="margin">Subſect. 4.</note> perſwade him to ſuch a change muſt be his Happineſs and Salvation in that which is to come. This indeed is the great End, the Higheſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon any Perſon can propoſe to himſelf in the Choyce of his Religion, that it be ſuch as will conduct him ſafely to Eternal Happineſs.</p>
               <p>Now if I can prove that there is no danger of miſſing this in the Communion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and that there is great and apparent Hazard of loſing it in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> then this can be no Reaſon for, nor Inducement to ſuch a change, it being moſt Abſur'd and Imprudent to Exchange a ſafe for a dangerous Church, a Church wherein there is a certainty, for one wherein there is at moſt but a bare poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Salvation.</p>

               <p>The enquiry then muſt be, if the caſe be not thus between ours, and the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> whether in that there be not a Certainty, in this at moſt but a meer Poſſibility of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>God the Supream Lord of Men, as he made them to Serve and Glorify him here, and to injoy or live with him in Immortal Glory and Happineſs hereafter, ſo it muſt needs belong to him alone to appoint what Service they ſhall Perform to him, to declare how, and in what inſtances he will be Honour'd and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifi'd by them, to preſcribe meaſures of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, and the terms or conditions upon which he will admit them to the Participation of that Supream and Soveraign Happineſs; for being the greateſt good that God can give, or they deſire, 'tis moſt unreaſonable to believe it Inconditional, promiſed abſolutely either to all, or a ſelect part of Mankind, ſo that they ſhall be ſure to have it, though they do nothing towards the Obtaining of it. And if it be propoſed upon certain Terms or Conditions, as it evidently is, God alone muſt determine and propoſe theſe; determine them, becauſe that tranſcendent Felicity being his Kind and Bountiful offer, none hath any Right but he to appoint the things that muſt be done by Men for the acquiring of it: Propoſe them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe 'till he hath Revealed them, none can know what they are. To leave Mankind to their own Fancies and Conjectures in a matter of ſuch Moment and Concern (to offer them Eternal Happineſs, and not tell them how to
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:44080:52"/> Obtain it) would have been a diſparagement to the Divine Goodneſs, becauſe it would have been to Mock and Delude them with the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of a Treaſure more precious then all the World, whch they knew not how to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs themſelves of, &amp; if they gueſs'd, at the way of doing of it, it would be great odds but they would miſtake and gueſs wrong, leave the true Pathes or means leading to ſo lovely and deſireable a good, and follow falſe ones, as we ſee all the Heathen World did in that prime part of Religion, the Worſhip of God. So that one of theſe two things muſt neceſſarily follow, either that God had no Purpoſe or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to ſave or make Mankind Eternally Happy, or if that be Inconſiſtent with his Mercy, and the Benignity of his Nature, that he did reveal or declare not only that he would do it, but alſo upon what Terms or Conditions he would be pleaſed to do it: which Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Royal Pleaſure in both the parts of it, being of the greateſt Moment or Concern both that Men might know and admire the Tranſcendent kindneſs of the Gracious Author of their being towards them, and be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently Inſtructed how to Expreſs or Declare their Gratitude for it, in fit and acceptable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns of Obedience and Duty to him, ought in Reaſon to be kept as the moſt precious Treaſure, and carefully preſerv'd from all Change and Injury, that it might deſcend ſafe and Intire to all Ages and Generations of Men, and ſo afford them full and Perfect Inſtruction, what they muſt believe and do, how they
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:44080:52"/> muſt live or behave themſelves in this, that they may obtain the Eternal Felicity of the other World.</p>
               <p>To tranſmit or hand down this Revelation from Age to Age, from Generation to Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, through all Succeeding time, from the firſt Publiſhing of it to the end of the World, by Oral Tradition, or word of Mouth, was not poſſible without continual Miracles, both to Preſerve it intire in the Minds and Memories of the Relators, and to aſlure thoſe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd it from them, that they had neither by fraud, nor forgetfulneſs Corrupted or changed it any way, added nothing to it, nor kept back any part of it: and ſeeing this might be ſecured another way by his common Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, why ſhould God multiply Miracles continually to no purpoſe; for without theſe ſuch a Treaſure could not be ſafely committed to ſuch a way of Conveyance, Oral Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being a very hazardous and uncertain way of delivering things to others, eſpecially at any great diſtance of time, and therefore the greater Moment the things are of, the more dangerous is it to truſt them to ſuch a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous &amp; Precarious way of Communicating them. We ſee how ſtrangely the Ancient Hiſtory of the World, and the greateſt Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions of it, whilſt they were thus Tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted were Depraved and Corrupted, ſo inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mix'd with Lies and Fables, as they paſſed down the Channel of Time and Ages, that the truth of things was either quite loſt, or very difficultly to be found out, being cover'd, or
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:44080:53"/> in a manner Buried under ſuch an heap of Dirt and Rubbiſh, that the Wiſeſt and moſt Sagacious minds, after all their care and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to ſearch it out, were very doubtful, and could not come to a full Determination what to believe, or what to reject: ſome things they ſaw had an appearance of Truth, but then the Fables mixt therewith, diſgrac'd, and render'd them ſo Suſpicious, that they knew not what to think of them.</p>
               <p>And therefore the All-wiſe and moſt Merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful God, as he was pleaſed to offer Immortal Happineſs to Mankind, and to tell them upon what terms or conditions he would admit them to, and bleſs them with it, ſo he took care to have theſe moſt weighty things Conveyed down to all Ages and Generations of Men in the ſafeſt way, requiring thoſe he imploy'd to deliver his Laws to Mankind, to commit them to Writing, nay delivering ſome of them, the Ten Commandments (that is) to <hi>Moſes</hi> Inſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or Written upon two Tables of Stone: <note place="margin">Exodus 32. 16.</note> which way of Tranſmitting them is moſt durable or laſting, and therefore the ſafeſt; and they that ſay the contrary, Reproach &amp; Diſparage the Wiſdom of God, becauſe he thought fit thus to Convey them to us: and when theſe Writings were compleated by the Addition of the New Teſtament to the Old, nothing could be wanting to inſtruct Mankind in all the parts of their Duty, and to tell them all the terms or Conditions of their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Happineſs and Salvation.</p>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:44080:53"/>
               <p>To ſay they are imperfect, and do not give Men ſufficient Direction for the attaining this great end, is to Blaſpheme the Glorious Author of them, to Arraign his Wiſdom, to revile his Goodneſs, and to contradict theſe Sacred Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, which call upon us to ſearch and ſtudy them, and invite us to perform the Duties they require of us, with the offer of Salvation if we do it, and the Denunciation of Damnation if we refuſe to do it: Now if all thoſe things uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or conjoyned cannot bring the obſervers of them to the Salvation they promiſe, then the Scriptures do not ſay true, and therefore God is not the Author of them.</p>
               <p>This the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth not, dares not ſay, but owns the Truth of all they ſay, and confeſſes them to come from God, only it ſays they are inſufficient and obſcure, that is, do not ſpeak enough, tell thoſe that conſult them, all things neceſſary to Salvation, nor ſpeak ſo plainly, and intelligibly as to be underſtood without an infallible Interpreter to declare the true, and full Senſe or Meaning of them.</p>
               <p>The firſt cannot be, becauſe if the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſay, <hi>do theſe things and thou ſhalt live,</hi> be Eternally happy, and Bleſſed; As for Inſtance, believe in Chriſt, Repent of thy Sins, keep the Commandments of God, and tell us what they are, as it is apparent they do, and promiſe Salvation to them that ſo believe, Repent, and keep the Commandments of God, then they ſpeak fully to the purpoſe, tell him or them that Read them, enough to ſave them, if they perform it, and conſequently muſt be ſufficient,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:44080:54"/> and then to add I know not what unwritten Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities (as they are called) as Supplements to them, is both a Wicked and a Vain thing; 'tis Wicked both as it invades Gods Authority, will not let him preſcribe &amp; appoint all the Terms or Conditions upon which he will give E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Life and Glory to his Church and People: Wicked alſo as it diſgraces his Laws, and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges them with defects they are not Guilty of. 'Tis vain too, and altogether needleſs, like Lighting up a Torch or a Candle, when the Sun Shines in all his Glory, for they that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee, or find the way to Heaven by the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Light, or Direction of the Holy Script<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, will never do it by the help of the dark Lanthern of Oral Tradition: this is apter to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, or draw thoſe that follow it out of the Right way, than to guide them into it: That can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deceive any, becauſe it gives them a full and perfect Deſcription of it, tells them, <hi>This is the way, walk ye in it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as they ſpeak fully to this great point, give an exact and perfect Anſwer to every one that asks them that Important Queſtion, <hi>What ſhall I do that I may have Eternal Life?</hi> So they ſpeak plainly and intelligibly to it, and every Reader may, if he brings with him an humble and Teachable Mind, Learn and underſtand all his Duty, his Duty as the Apoſtle divides it, to God, his Neighbour and himſelf: to God in Acts of Piety, to his Neighbour in Acts of Juſtice and Charity, to himſelf in Acts of Temperance or Sobriety.</p>
               <p>'Tis very Fooliſh, as well as Sinful, for Men
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:44080:54"/> to cry out of the Obſcurity or Darkneſs of the Scriptures, only to ſerve a Worldly Intereſt by it, when thoſe parts of them that deſcribe our Duty, are ſaid to be a Light, <hi>a Light unto our Pathes, and a Lantern to our Feet,</hi> thoſe muſt needs be Blind that cannot ſee the Light, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the Nature or Property of it to be Viſible. 'Tis true indeed there are degrees of Light, one Light being greater and more Radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant than another: thus the Law was a Light, but yet weak and dimm in Compare with the Goſpel, which is ſo great and Illuſtrious a Light, that the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>If it be hid, it is hid to them that Periſh,</hi> that are ſo in Love with their Sins as to reſolve to perſiſt though they Periſh in them, and therefore ſhut their Eyes againſt the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, which comes as a Light to ſhew them their Errour.</p>
               <p>They that ſay the Scriptures are Obſcure, and unintelligible, muſt ſay that either God could not, or would not declare his Mind, ſo as to be underſtood by Men: If they ſay the firſt, they degrade him, becauſe if he could not do it, he hath not the Wiſdom or Intelligence of a Man, and therefore cannot be God, every Man of Common Senſe, that is able to ſpeak, being alſo able to ſpeak his Mind, ſo as to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood. If they ſay the other, they Vilifie and Diſgrace him, for if he would not ſpeak ſo that Men might underſtand him, then it is meer mockery to offer them Eternal Happineſs upon ſuch Conditions as they do not, cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, and hateful Cruelty to threaten them with Everlaſting and Intolerable Puniſhment,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:44080:55"/> for Tranſgreſſing ſuch Laws, and omitting ſuch Duties as are above their apprehenſion.</p>
               <p>To ſay as the Papiſts do, that God hath took care to remedy this Obſcurity of the Scriptures by appointing an Infallible Guide or Interpreter to explicate or unridle the meaning of them, and that he cannot Err in the doing of it, is to ſay that which all the World can never Prove: for how doth it appear that God hath Conſtituted or Commiſſion'd him to be the Sole Expounder of Scripture, more than any other Biſhop, or Doctor of the Church? Doth not our Lord ſay to all the Apoſtles, nay to the ſeventy Diſciples, <hi>He that heareth you, heareth me?</hi> Did not he ſpeak to them all, when he ſaid, <hi>Go ye into all the World and Preach the Goſpel to every Creature?</hi> How then came his Holyneſs to have the Monopoly, or Sole power of Interpreting Scripture? Did it deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend to him from St. <hi>Peter?</hi> that cannot be, becauſe he never claim'd, never pretended to it, never had it Solely himſelf, and the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor cannot without Uſurpation chalenge a greater Power nor plead a larger Commiſſion than he had whom he pretends to Succeed. 'Tis certain that all the Apoſtles received an equal Authority, and the ſame Commiſſion from Chriſt, and therefore all Biſhops now, being the undoubted Succeſſors of the Apoſtles, have an equal Power and Right to Interpret Scripture: and there is by Divine Right no difference at all between them; what is, is either by Humane Conſtitution, or by Uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Incroachment.</p>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:44080:55"/>
               <p>And if he connot ſhew a Patent from God to prove him to be the only Authoritative In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter of his Laws, how will he make good the other proud Word which he prefixes before it, That he is the only and Infallible Expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Scripture: He knows very well that a great, and the wiſeſt part of the World deny his Infallibility, and Laugh at him for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to it.</p>
               <p>How then will he convince them that he hath it? by Reaſon? no, no! that gives no Teſtimony to ſuch a groſs and palpable Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity, Reaſon ſays to be a Man, and to be Exempt from all Poſſibility of Errour, are Inconſiſtent. Will he prove it by Scripture? ſome Texts are brought from thence for faſhion ſake to colour the buſineſs, as thoſe that contain the promiſe of our Lord to his Apoſtles, <hi>to ſend them the Holy Ghoſt to guide or</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>St.</hi> John 16. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>lead them into all Truth:</hi> but this promiſe either proves too little, or too much to do the feat: for either it is a Peculiar promiſe belonging to the Apoſtles only, who needed an Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Aſſiſtance from Chriſt, that they might Tranſmit his Doctrine full and intire to Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Ages, and then was Perſonal and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired with them, and ſo doth not concern his Holyneſs, for though the Holy Ghoſt guided them into all Truth, yet he, either not having the Holy Ghoſt, or Refuſing to follow his guidances, may run into all Errour.</p>
               <p>Or if it was not a Perſonal or Peculiar pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe belonging to the Apoſtles only, but E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually to their Succeſſors, then it proves more
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:44080:56"/> than he would have it, That all the Biſhops in the World are Infallible; for the promiſe was made, not to <hi>St. Peter</hi> only, but to all the Apoſtles, and therefore what nonſenſe, and Ridiculous Partiallity is it to Reſtrain a gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al promiſe made to the whole Colledg of Apoſtles, to the Succeſſours of one of them; for if they that Succeed St. <hi>Peter</hi> be Fully and Perfectly lead into all Truth, then the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors of all the Apoſtles are ſo, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently all the Biſhops in the World are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, and then his Holineſs will have but a bad Market for his Expoſitions of Scripture; for few People will be at the trouble to go to <hi>Rome</hi> for them, becauſe they may have them from their own Biſhops. Well, but doth not our Lord ſay to St. <hi>Peter; Thou art Peter, and upon this Rock I will Build my Church, and the Gates</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">St. Mat. 16. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>of Hell ſhall not Prevail againſt it.</hi> Theſe are certainly the Words of Chriſt, but they confer no peculiar Priviledg or Prerogative upon St. <hi>Peter,</hi> nothing but what was equally given to all the Apoſtles, for the <hi>Rock</hi> Signifies either his Confeſſion, <hi>Thou art Chriſt the Son of the living God,</hi> which is the <hi>Rock,</hi> the great and <note place="margin">Vers 16.</note> Fundamental Article of the Chriſtian Faith, upon which the Church is Built: or if it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern his Perſon, that he ſhould be an Excellent Inſtrument (as the other Apoſtles were, and therefore are alſo called Foundation Stones) to bring in Converts and Diſciples unto Chriſt, and to raiſe or Build him up a Church in the World, which the Gates of Hell, all the Power
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:44080:56"/> and Policy of the Devil ſhould never be able Totally to ruin or deſtroy.</p>
               <p>Theſe Words then ſpeak nothing for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Infallibility. And indeed the greateſt Champions for it, are ſo far from thinking it fully proved in Scripture, that they are not agreed about it. To fix it in the Popes Perſon they dare not, becauſe the many and groſs Errours of his Life, would confute and ſhame them, and therefore as a Man they confeſs he can, and may, and doth Err: To aſcribe it to his Chair, either to his Office or Dignity as Biſhop, or to him as Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and Succeſſor to St. <hi>Peter</hi> in that Patriarchal See, is ſilly, for if he could Err before, he can do ſo ſtill, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his being made Biſhop doth not change his Nature, but his Office: and being the ſame Man, why may he not be the ſame falliable or erring Man he was before? The place he is Biſhop of can make no Difference in the caſe, becauſe no reaſon can be given why the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould be more Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt from Errour, than the Biſhop of <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To place the Infallibility in the Pope and a general Council is as unreaſonable, becauſe if they can Err apart, they may united, and they confeſs, that a general Council may Err, if it be not Confirmed by the Pope, and tis plain they think the Pope without it may Err, or elſe tis idle to add a general Council to him, but the uniting or putting two Erring parties together cannot make them Infallible: To ſay that a General Council Confirm'd by the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:44080:57"/> Pope cannot Err, is unanſwerably confuted by this argument of a great and excellent perſon: <hi>The Pope never Confirms, a Council till it be finiſh'd,</hi>

                  <hi>when it is finiſh'd, before the Popes Confirmation be put to it, either it hath Erred, or not Erred, if it hath Erred he ought not to confirm it, or if he do, it is a voyd Act, becauſe no power can make Errour or falſehood to be Truth: if it hath not Erred, then it was True before he Confirmed it, and ſo his Confirmation ſignifies nothing.</hi> And not withſtanding all the ſtir they make about the Popes Infallibility, they do not believe it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, for the School-Men and Writers of Controverſies, as that Author obſerves, put the caſe, <hi>whether the Pope coming to be an Heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi>

                  <hi>may not be Depoſed,</hi> and the Common Law (as he adds) ſays expreſly, <hi>That he may be Depoſed for Hereſie:</hi> now if he can fall into Hereſie, and may be Depoſed for it, then he cannot be Infallible: And as the Scriptures give no teſtimony of it, ſo neither reaſon, nor any thing elſe can prove his Holineſs to be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, becauſe he is not, and there is no need that either he or any other Biſhop ſhould be ſo, becauſe God hath fully and clearly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to us in the Scriptures all things nece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſary to Salvation, as I have already Prov'd, and for that part of them that is obſcure, we are certain we may be Saved, without the knowledg of it, otherwiſe the Merciful God that loves us, and deſires our Salvation, would have made it plain to us.</p>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:44080:57"/>
               <p>Now, to bring this Diſcourſe home to the great Point in hand, if Eternal Happineſs and Salvation be the kind offer or Propoſal of God, and this cannot be had but upon certain Terms or Conditions, which muſt be determin'd and reveal'd by him: determin'd becauſe that is his Right, and none but he hath Authority to do it: reveal'd, becauſe unleſs he declare upon what Terms he will ſave them, Mankind can never know them, nor conſequently obtain the propoſed happineſs; and thoſe Terms or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions be fully and intirely, plainly and intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligibly deliver'd in the Scriptures, then that, and none but that, is the true Church (in which Salvation may certainly be had) that adheres or cleaves to the Scriptures, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows them as the great and only Rule of Faith and Manners, of all things (that is) neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to Salvation. This is the only ſure Mark of the true Church that may be rely'd upon, without this all other Signs are falſe Fires and deceitful Lights that miſlead their unwary fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, but he that chuſes his Church by its Profeſſion of the Chriſtian Faith and Doctrine contained in the Scriptures, is ſafe, and in ſuch a Society where nothing is wanting to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but if he leaves that he may wander up and down the World in vain, ſeeking Reſt but finding none.</p>
               <p>All then that will be neceſſary to make good my Aſſertion in both the parts of it, that there is a certainty of Salvation in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and at moſt but a Poſſibility of it in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is briefly to ſhew the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

               <p>That Church which affirms that the Holy Scriptures Comprehend all things neceſſary to Salvation, and that nothing but what is contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in them, is to be preſs'd or requir'd as ſuch, and receives them as its ſole or intire Rule, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees fully and perfectly with them, but our Church affirms thoſe, and doth this, therefore it adheres, or keeps cloſe to the Scriptures: <hi>Holy Scripture</hi> (it ſaith) <hi>containeth all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary</hi>

               <p>This is as full a Declaration of the perfection &amp; ſufficiency of the Scriptures as can be made; and that our Church receives them as the ſole or intire Rule of Faith, is ſo Evident that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> confeſſeth it, by making it an Accuſation or Objection againſt it (though this

               <p>As great Aſſurance Aſſurance then as any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian hath that the Scriptures are true, ſo full and abſolute a certainty is there of Salvation in our Church; becauſe it teaches and requires all thoſe things, and no other, that the Scriptures teach and require as neceſſary to Salvation, and to the Performers of which, they promiſe Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life and Happineſs; and therefore if the Scriptures ſay true (as all Chriſtians acknowledg they do) there can be no doubt or queſtion at all of being ſaved in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> unleſs Men will either not believe and Live as it teacheth and Commands them, or if they do it, will not perſevere or continue in ſo believing and Living to the end of their Lives.</p>
               <p>And therefore that none who are Members of this moſt Holy and Excellent Church, may deprive themſelves of ſo great a good, as that Immortal Happineſs is, by their Evil and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuitable Living, I ſhall conclude this Diſcourſe with that admirable Exhortation, which their Mother the Church gives them to obey or keep the Commandments of God their Father, which is this,</p>

               </p>
               <p>'Tis as impoſſible as any thing can be, that they who do theſe things, and continue in them to the end of their Lives, ſhould miſs of Eternal Glory and Happineſs: To ſay that ſuch a Faith, ſuch Obedience, ſuch a Life (as our Church propounds and Teacheth) perſiſted in till they paſs out of this World, cannot (through the Merits of Chriſt) Save Men, is to Damn the Bleſſed Apoſtles, and all the Primitive Saints and Martyrs, who, if they went to Heaven at all, went thither by believing and Living accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Scriptures, and call upon us to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their Faith, their pure or unſpotted Lives, conſidering the end of their Converſation, the Glories in which they ſhine in the Bleſſed man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions above: This is the Rock upon which we of the Church of <hi>England</hi> Build our hopes of a Crown of Glory: this is a Guide that cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, but will lead us ſafely to the Bleſſed place we aſpire after: they that walk by this Rule (the Rule of the Holy Scripture) are in a ſure way to Salvation, and if they perſevere, cannot miſs of it.</p>
               <p>But if we remove our Thoughts now to the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> it will be Evident that there is at moſt but a <hi>Poſſibility of Salvation in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of it;</hi> becauſe of its diſagreement with, and repugnancy to the Holy Scriptures.</p>
               <p>So far is this Church from doing them the Right and the Honour as to confeſs, that they comprehend all things neceſſary to Salvation, that it affirms the contrary, that they do it not
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:44080:60"/> without the help of <hi>Traditions,</hi> which they of that Communion receive and Honour with an equal Devotion and Reverence: So ſaith the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> expreſly, <hi>Sacroſancta oecumenica &amp; generalis Tridentina Synodus in ſpiritu ſancto</hi>

               </p>
               <p>So that their Rule of Faith conſiſts of two diſtinct parts, the Scriptures and Traditions, the word of God written, and the word of God
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:44080:61"/> not written, but tranſmitted by word of Mouth, from Age to Age, from Generation to Gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Now though it be certain that the word of God be equally true, and equally obligato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to all Perſons, whether it be written or not written, which way ſoever it be propounded or convey'd to them, yet how ſhall it appear or be proved that what they call the Unwritten word of God, is really ſo, &amp; not a wicked cheat &amp; impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture? They ſay it is his word, we ſay it is not, the Primitive Church ſaith nothing at all of it, but aſſerts and maintains the ſufficiency or fullneſs of the Scriptures, or written word of God, that is, that it contains all things neceſſary to be believed and done to the obtaining Eternal Life and Happineſs, as is fully proved by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Proteſtant Writers; And when the Ancient and Orthodox Fathers ſpeak of Traditions, and call upon any to obſerve and obey them, they either mean by thoſe Traditions, the Doctrine of Chriſt deliver'd to the Chriſtian Church in the Writings of the Apoſtles, or the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces made, either by the Apoſtles themſelves, or the Biſhops that ſucceeded them in their Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Office, for the decent and orderly perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of Gods Worſhip.</p>
               <p>The firſt is indeed the Word of God, but then it is his written word; the other are not the word of God at all, but humane Conſtitutions, and no farther Obligatory, than they are agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the General Rules the Scriptures give for Conducting the Circumſtances of Religion, the Church having Power (as Ours truly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms) to Decree <hi>Rites and Ceremonies, and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi>

                  <hi>in Controverſies of Faith, though it be not Lawful for the Church to Ordain any thing that is contrary to Gods word written.</hi> This is all the Ancient Fathers mean by Traditions, when they ſpeak of, or require the Obſervation of them, but they make no ſuch Diſtinction as this of the written and unwritten word of God, neither do they ſay, that the firſt is imperfect, or doth not ſufficiently inſtruct Mankind to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, unleſs it be ſupply'd with the other. This is a Blaſphemy which the Apoſtate Church only is guilty of, but was never heard of in the Primitive times: Beſides, the Holy Scriptures, or written word of God, (as I remarked before) call upon us to ſearch, and ſtudy, and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate in them, nay to believe and obey, or Live according to them, and Promiſe Eternal Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs and Salvation to all that do theſe things: but they make no mention of the word of God not written, do not Command any to enquire, or ſearch after, or trouble their Heads about any ſuch thing as the Unwritten word of God: 'Tis true indeed St. <hi>Paul</hi> praiſes the Obedient Members of the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> that kept <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 2.</note> the Traditions or Ordinances which he deliver'd to them; But theſe were no part of the word of God either written or not written, but things in their own nature Indifferent; That the Men ſhould Pray in publick with their Heads un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd, and the Women with their Heads co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd. <note place="margin">Verſes 4th, and 5th.</note>

               <p>Beſides, it is, and muſt be, with all thinking
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:44080:63"/> Men, a mighty Objection againſt this Unwrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten word of God (as they call it) that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath the ſole Cuſtody or keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it: the Primitive Church, after the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non of the Scriptures was compleated, ſays no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all of it; for all the Fathers cry up, and maintain the Perfection and Sufficiency of the written word of God, and all the Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Churches adhere to this in Oppoſition to that Unwritten Word; How then came <hi>Rome</hi> by it? Is God ſo partial, ſuch a Reſpecter of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, as to Communicate it to that Church, and not to others? Or is it a Cheat, or Artifice of the <hi>nequam ingenioſi,</hi> the witty or Crafty Decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers to help at a dead lift? This is the very Truth! Many of their Doctrines and Practices, they plainly perceiv'd, did openly claſh with, and contradict the Holy Scriptures, or written word of God, and therefore there was no way to defend them, to acquit their Church from Errour and Impiety, but to cry up Tradition, and make it of equal Authority with the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: But this will not do it, for doth God uſe to contradict himſelf? There are that ſay, he hath two Wills, the one ſecret, the other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd, and that the one is contrary to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which is neither better nor worſe than downright Blaſphemy; the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> with equal Blaſphemy affirms, that God hath two Laws or Words, the one contained in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the other tranſmitted by Oral Tradition, and they plead this in Defence of thoſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines which are contrary to that, being beaten from the Scriptures, and having no ſhelter or
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:44080:63"/> protection for their Errours there, they Fly for refuge to Tradition, as if that could bear them out, or ſupport their Cauſe, and ſo they make the infinitely Wiſe and Righteous God contradict himſelf, which he muſt needs do, if he hath declared his will to Mankind two ſeveral ways, (that is,) by Scritpure and Oral Tradition, and this affirms things which that deny's and gainſays: They had rather, if they could do it, prove the points in controverſy by the Scriptures, as the moſt ſatisfactory and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing proof; but not being able to do that, they are conſtrained either to confeſs their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, or to pretend Tradition to vouch and countenance them: That they will not do; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is againſt their Worldly Intereſt, incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with their Honour and Profit: This they had better not do, becauſe the Cheat is ſo Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that none but weak Perſons will be gull'd and deluded by it; for we know that muſt needs be an Abominable Cheat, which they call the Unwritten word of God, becauſe by this they evacuate or make the other voy'd and of no Effect, Command what in the Scripture God forbids, and forbid what he Commands, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn what he allows, allow what he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns, make that neceſſary which he leaves Arbitrary or Indifferent, and that Indifferent which he makes neceſſary, uſing the Scriptures as one <hi>Procuſtes</hi> a Theeviſh Inn-keeper in <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> is ſaid to have Treated his Gueſts, who having but one Bed for all Comers, if he that was to lye in it was too long for the Bed, he would cut off his Feet or Legs till he had made him of
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:44080:64"/> an equal length for it, if too ſhort, he would rack and ſtretch him out, till he had made him of a fit ſize for it: Thus doth <hi>Rome</hi> by her Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions inlarge and alter, add to and take from, pervert and wreſt the Scriptures to her own, and the Deſtruction of Multitudes of thoſe that give up themſelves to her Conduct.</p>
               <p>For I deſire it may be conſidered, what an horrid injury and affront it is to the Laws of God, to thoſe Sacred Books, that contain ſo Choice and moſt Precious a Treaſure, as the Words of Eternal Life which they propound to us, muſt needs be, to uſe them thus: Nay what abominable inſolence and contempt of God it is to accuſe them of Inperfection, to affirm they do not give Men ſufficient Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Salvation, which they ſay they do? Is there any thing that Princes do more highly reſent, or more ſeverely Puniſh than the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of their Laws, and Royal Edicts: when inſtead of paying a ready and cheereful O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to them, any Perſons cenſure and carp at them; Falſly call them obſcure and defective Inſtitutions, that do not reach the ends or deſigns they were made for, and take upon them to forge new ones, to put out Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit Edicts and Mandates in the Princes name which he knew nothing of, and gave no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to: Juſt thus doth the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> treat the Great Lord and Ruler of all the World, accuſes his Laws (contained in the Scriptures) of Imperfection, ſay's they are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure and defective, dark and unintelligible Inſtitutions in themſelves, and forges new ones
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:44080:64"/> which it calls his Traditional or Unwriten Laws, and is Fonder of, or Prefers them before the other, which muſt needs provoke his Anger, and bring down his moſt fearful Judgments upon it, even all the Woes, Plagues, and Curſes denounc'd in Scripture againſt them that commit ſo Inſolent and Hainous a Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs.</p>
               <p>And as they affront and diſhonour the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures by receiving Traditions with equal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and devotion, ſo in defiance to them they have Inlarged the Faith, Multiply'd the Sacraments, Chang'd all the Principal parts of Religion, which they propound to the Chriſtian Church: They neither Believe nor Worſhip God according to the Scriptures, but to the Faith once delivered to the Saints, they have added new and falſe Propoſitions, and inſtead of the Pure and Holy Worſhip God requires, diſgrace and provoke him with their Images, and leaving the old Paths, and the good way of his appointing, they have invented new means and conditions of Salvation; For all the points Controverted between Them &amp; Us, are plainly and evidently Repugnant to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as would appear by a particular Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of them: But this is not proper to the Subject I have in hand, and hath been ſo fully and Unanſwerably proved by many Eminent Divines of our Church, Famous in their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, Men of Renown, the excellent Biſhop <hi>Jewel,</hi> Dr. <hi>Feild,</hi> the two <hi>Whites,</hi> the Arch-deacon in his <hi>way to the true Church,</hi> and his Brother the Biſhop of <hi>Ely</hi> in his Defence

               <p>And if they depart from the Scriptures, (as tis certain they do) which only are able to make Men wiſe unto Salvation, and by which all Chriſtians ſhall be judged at the laſt and great Aſſize of the World, there muſt needs (as all the Reformed Churches truly believe and teach) be great peril of Damnation in the Communion of that Church: They are out of the way which God commands all Men to walk in, that would obtain the Immortal Glories and Felicities of his Heavenly Kingdom; and therefore if they be Saved it muſt be by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary ways or means. 'Tis poſſible that God (whoſe Mercies are Infinite) may ſave the Ignorant and well meaning People amongſt them, that follow the Romiſh Guides in the <note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Potter</hi> Anſwer to Charity miſtaken. page 78, 79.</note> Simplicity of their Hearts, <hi>Who either have not</hi> (as a learned Perſon of our Church obſerves) <hi>ſufficient means to find the truth, or elſe after the uſe of the beſt means they can have, find not

               </p>
               <p>To go from a ſafe Church as Ours is (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there is a Certainty of Salvation) to ſuch a Dangerous Church as the <hi>Roman</hi> is, (wherein there is but a meer Poſſibility of it) is a wilder and more unaccountable Errour or overſight, than if a Man that was to Sail in a Rough, Dangerous, and Tempeſtuous Sea, full of Rocks and Sands, ſhould refuſe a ſtout and
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:44080:66"/> well built Ship, that had Skilful, Careful, and Honeſt Pilates, and chuſe one that is Craſy, and full of Leaks or Breaches to let in the angry and devouring Billows, and is ſteered by ſuch Pilates as are either Treacherous or Careleſs, Ignorant or Knaviſh.</p>
               <p>His Royal Highneſs then had no reaſon to change his Religion upon this account, his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Happineſs and Salvation being certain and undoubted by his ſtay in our Church, (that is) by believeing and living as it teaches and requires all its Members to believe, and lead their lives; But exceeding doubtful and hazardous, no more than poſſible in the Romiſh Communion. And being neither for his Intereſt in this, nor his Happineſs in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World, to turn Papiſt, his Royall Highneſs could have no juſt Motive or Inducement to do it.</p>
               <p>Theſe Arguments, as they prove the Duke ought not, ſo they will Oblige all that conſider them, to queſtion whether he hath changed his Religion, for being a wiſe Prince, how can he be Guilty of ſo Deplorable an Errour, as to do that, which is againſt his intereſt now, and his Happineſs for ever, that will make him In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious whilſt he lives, and Miſerable when he is Dead and gone.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Excluders</hi> will ſay, this is to doubt whether the Sun Shines, when he appears in <note place="margin">Subſect. 5.</note> his higheſt or noon day Glory, to queſtion mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fact, for did not his Royal Highneſs <hi>refuſe the Oaths and Subſcription againſt Popery,</hi>
                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:44080:67"/> and do not <hi>Colemans</hi> Letters <hi>ſpeak of his Zeal for the Romiſh Church and Religion, and if he be not a Papiſt, why doth he not declare himſelf, and ſatisfy the Nation that he is of the Eſtabliſh'd Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion?</hi> theſe things they ſay make it Evident to all, that will not ſhut their Eyes, that the Duke is a Papiſt.</p>
               <p>As for the firſt, his <hi>Refuſing the Oaths and Subſcription againſt Popery,</hi> That is no evidence of his being a Papiſt, becauſe he might have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for that <hi>Refuſall.</hi> He might think it a diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to him, being a Prince of the Blood, and next Heir to the Crown, to take the Oaths, and make the Subſcription, which every Juſtice of the Peace, and every Captain in the Militia, and perſons inferiour to theſe, were by that Law Obliged to do. Is there any thing that a brave &amp; generous Prince, ſuch as his Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is, Is more tender of, than his Honour? And would it not have been a leſſening and impairing of that, a deſcending from his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, a ſtooping much below himſelf to take thoſe Oaths, and Subſcribe as every perſon that hath any Office Civil or Military, is by that Law required to do? Sure there is ſome difference to be put, and ſome diſtinction to be made, between a Prince and Men of lower degree, between a Son of the late, and a Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the only Brother, of this preſent King, and other Subjects.</p>
               <p>'Tis true indeed, the Duke whilſt the King lives, is but a Subject, but then he is the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, the greateſt Subject, next to the King both in Blood and Dignity, and hath ſuch a property,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:44080:67"/> and capacity as no other Subject hath, and therefore what may be Honourable enough for other Subjects to do, may look meanly in him, and be in his own Apprehenſion, if not in the Opinion of others, a leſſening his Eſteem, and impairing his Honour.</p>
               <p>The Dukes Refuſal too might proceed from a juſt diſlike, and averſion to the great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triver and Promoter of that Law, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd the taking thoſe Oaths, and the making that Subſcription; a Man Popular, Ambitious, Buſy, and Deſigning, and, as ſince appears, moſt Trayterous and Diſloyal, who had misbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved himſelf towards his Royal Highneſs, and without any Provocation was become his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, and openly profeſſ'd or declared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo to be; the Duke, I ſay, might juſtly hate the Child for the Fathers ſake, refuſe to obſerve a Law Contriv'd and Promoted by his open Enemy; to comply with, and do thoſe things at the Motion of Such an One, being both diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable in it ſelf, and that which would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the Man to more, and greater rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſaucineſs towards him, and ſet his invention a work to frame new Impoſitions, and lay greater Burthens upon him, there being no end of ſome mens Projects and Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinencies, and if they be humour'd in one thing, they will demand an hundred, and grudg if they be not ſatisfied, and if you do not let them lead you by the Noſe as long, and as far as they pleaſe, your firſt complyance is Slighted or Contemn'd as a thing of no worth, nor merit; and therefore the beſt way
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:44080:68"/> to be freed from ſuch Troubleſome and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing perſons, is to withſtand, or give them a repulſe at the firſt; for if they find a Man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute, and not to be wrought upon, they will be diſcouraged, and in time give over their Impertinent and Saucy attempts.</p>
               <p>Beſides the Dukes taking the Oaths and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing could not have acquitted him from the Suſpition of Popery with them, that were deſirous he ſhould be reputed, that they might treat him as a Papiſt; for ſo long as his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs pretends a power to grant Diſpenſations, and is willing to exerciſe, or put that power into practice, which he will do as long, as he hath any Zeal for the Catholick cauſe, or any Concern for his own gain and profit, ſo long they that love to brand others with the hatefull name of Papiſts, will think, or call them ſo, notwithſtanding all the Oaths they can take, and the Subſcriptions they can make againſt it, becauſe 'tis poſſible they may, and eaſie to ſay, nay to perſwade Credulous People, they have Diſpenſations from him to do ſuch things.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Colemans</hi> Letters (they ſay) <hi>ſpeake of the Dukes Zeal for the Romiſh Church and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> therefore he is not only a Papiſt, but a Zealous one: the inference is not certain, becauſe though thoſe Letters ſay ſo, yet they may ſpeak falſly. What are Papiſts ſo great lovers of Truth, as to make any Conſcience of telling a Lye? Do not the <hi>Excluders</hi> think them a Faithleſs and Deceitful Generation, and Men that have no truth in them? Do they
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:44080:68"/> not believe that the Jeſuites, and others (nay <hi>Coleman</hi> himſelf) that were Executed for the Popiſh Plot, who aſſerted their Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, and deny'd themſelves to be Guilty of, or Privy to any ſuch deſign, at their Death, do they not believe, I ſay, that theſe Men Dyed with an Impudent and Notorious Lye in their Mouthes? And if they dare do that at their Death, to be ſure they are not affraid to do it at other times, when they apprehend no harm nor danger near them.</p>
               <p>They that are ſo Prodigal of the Blood of Princes, as to think it Lawful, nay Merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to kill them, will make no Conſcience of Blaſpheming and Slandering them, of ſpeaking all Words that may do them Harm and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, blaſt and ſtain their Honour, render them Suſpected to, and Rob them of the Love, Eſteem, and Reverence of their People. Was not that glorious Prince King <hi>Charles</hi> the Martyr (as I obſerved before) Reproach'd and Ruin'd by the Odious name of Papiſt, which his Enemy's falſly caſt upon him? and can any Man think the Jeſuits, and other Zealots of the Romiſh Faction were careleſs or backward to ſpread ſo Miſchievous a Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, to publiſh ſuch a ſtory as would Expoſe him to the Hatred and Contempt of a great part of his People? for knowing him to be ſo Zealous and Reſolved a Proteſtant, that he could never be gain'd to their Church, their Malice and Reveng prompted them to call, or report him a Papiſt, that they might Inrage and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke his Subjects to take Armes againſt him.</p>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:44080:69"/>
               <p>But there can be no Colour nor Pretence for this, the <hi>Excluders</hi> will ſay, becauſe <hi>Colemans</hi> Letters were not writ to Proteſtants, but Papiſts, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore tell a true, not feigned Story. Suppoſing them to be writ to Papiſts, why may they not only declare <hi>Colemans</hi> Opinion of his Royal Highneſs? Or elſe be an Artifice or Trick of <hi>Colemans</hi> to get Mony of the <hi>French</hi> Kings Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor. Declare the Opinion he had of the Duke; for Men of that Church are very Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous (otherwiſe they would not be of it) apt to believe any thing they either deſire or fancy: if a Man ſhew them the leaſt Kindneſs, chance to ſpeak any thing in Favour of their Church, though it be little and inconſiderable, and he have no Thought nor Intention ever to be a Proſelyte to it, they believe preſently he is theirs, and tell it far and near what a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert they have gain'd, when no ſuch thing is, &amp; 'tis probable will never be done, &amp; therefore what thoſe Letters ſpeak of the Dukes Zeal for the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, may be no more but a vain glorious Brag, or confident Fancy of him that pen'd them: or elſe a crafty Trick, or Wheedle to get Mony from <hi>France,</hi> or <hi>Rome,</hi> or Both, by the Confeſſors intereſt in both thoſe Courts, to carry on the Plot in <hi>England, Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> knowing very well, that ſuch a Story as this of the Dukes Zeal for the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion, would be a mighty Motive or Inducement to prompt his Holineſs, and all the Zealots of that Communion to a great and Liberal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution, the Deſign they had in hand being ſo expenſive, that it would too much exhauſt and
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:44080:69"/> impoveriſh the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Catholicks to manage, or carry it on at their own Charge.</p>
               <p>Well, but if the Duke be not a Papiſt, why doth he not ſay ſo? Why doth he keep the Nation in Suſpence? Why doth he not declare himſelf of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly profeſs the moſt Holy and Excellent Religion Eſtabliſhed in it? To theſe Queries divers An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers may be given: That he hath declared it; for in his Speech to the Lord Mayor and Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the City of <hi>London,</hi> he ſaid (if my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence deceive me not)</p>

               <p>If this be not plain enough, <hi>His Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs hath declared ſince</hi> (if my Information be true, as I believe it was) <hi>That he was ſatisfied this Monarchy had no true Friends but the Church of</hi> England. And if he be ſo perſwaded of is,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:44080:70"/> (as he hath the higheſt reaſon to be) how can he be of any other Church? Will a Prince that is next Heir to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Crown, depart from a Church he confeſſes to be the only true Friend to it, and joyn himſelf to one which by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, he acknowledges to be no true Friend to it? This is too unreaſonable to be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
               <p>But theſe, if they be admitted, they will ſay, are but private Declarations, and not ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally known, nor ſo ſatisfactory as a publick Declaration would be. The firſt was publick enough being made to the Lord Mayor and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen of <hi>London.</hi> Would they have him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare it in Parliament; He may do ſo if he pleaſes; but it would be to no purpoſe to do it in an Excluding Parliament, for if he tell them never ſo ſeriouſly that he is no Papiſt, they will not believe him: Should he make the moſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Proteſtations, take all the Oathes and Teſts that can be devis'd, Vow, Swear, receive the moſt Bleſſed Sacrament upon it, call the Pope Antichriſt, and Heretick, give him all the hard words, and infamous Appellations he could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, it would be in Vain; for the <hi>Excluders</hi> would not believe him, but ſay he had a Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation to ſay and do all theſe things: And therefore, if he be never ſo deſirous to declare it in Parliament, Common Prudence will oblige him to ſtay, till the <hi>Excluders</hi> are ſhut out of it, and Men of better Principles, and a more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate temper are elected in their ſtead. To do it before, would be to tell them that
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:44080:70"/> which they have no Mind to hear, and no Faith to believe, and what can it be but loſt Labour, and a vain Attempt to go about to ſatisfie Men that will never be ſatisfied? A time may come, and I hope it is approaching, when ſuch a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration will not only be believ'd, but receiv'd with the joyful Acclamations, and grateful Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments of both Houſes, <hi>and if it be thy Bleſſed will, Oh God, let ſuch a time</hi> (a time ſo much deſired by all good Men) <hi>come, and that quickly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But for my part, I do not think it civil or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent for thoſe that are unacquainted with the greateſt affairs of State, to take upon them to preſcribe to his Royal Highneſs, or to tell him when, or in what manner, he ſhould declare himſelf, becauſe this would Savour of Rudeneſs and Preſumption, and therefore they muſt leave it to his own Prudence, and the Wiſe Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of thoſe Great and Honourable Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages, that underſtand and conduct the weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty concerns of the Government, it being for Them to know the times and ſeaſons of ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant an Action, and not for Men of privacy, and low degree.</p>
               <p>Stay a while then, and conſider what you are doing, be not too confident, Oh ye <hi>Exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> make not ſo much haſt, nor ſuch a ſtir to ſhut the door upon a Prince, that you are not ſure is gone from you, believe it poſſible for you to Err, or be Miſtaken in your Opinions of him: you ſee he hath no Reaſon to be a Papiſt, and the Arguments for it are inſufficient, do

               <p>So far I have conſider'd the firſt Queſtion, <hi>Whether his Royal Highneſs be a Papiſt?</hi> The next and great Enquiry is, <hi>Whether if he be ſo, that Forfeits his Right?</hi> That it doth not, I aſſert and am now to prove: In order to which I affirm, That it is poſſible for a Good, Conſcientious, and well meaning Man, one that deſires to go the Right way to Heaven, to turn Papiſt. Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour may look ſo like Truth, and Superſtition be ſo adorn'd with the paint and fair colours of true Piety, that Men of good underſtanding, and great integrity may be deceived and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded by it. Thus the excellent <hi>Chillingworth,</hi> a Pious and Learned Man, was ſeduced to the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, though by the Grace of God he ſaw his errour, return'd to our Church, and lived and died in the Holy and Apoſtolical Faith which it profeſſeth, and not long after his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to it (mindful of that ſacred precept of our Lord to St. <hi>Peter, when thou art converted, ſtrengthen by Brethren</hi>) writ his excellent Book, <note place="margin">St. Luke 22. 32.</note> in which he fully and unanſwerably proves that which is the Subject or Title of it, <hi>That the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of Proteſtants is a ſafe way to Salvation,</hi> (a Book highly meriting the peruſal of all, that either need, or deſire ſatisfaction in that Great and moſt weighty point.) In the Preface to it he tells his Readers the Motives that perſwaded him to turn Papiſt, which though they were (as
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:44080:71"/> he truly calls them, and to which he there gives full and ſatisfactory anſwers) ſilly So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſms, and falſe Suppoſitions, yet they ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed that good Man, as to Proſelyte him to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> And why may not others as Pious, Prudent, and Conſcientious as he, be deceiv'd and miſled into Popery by theſe, or ſuch fallacious Arguments or Reaſons? 'Tis ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well known that the Jeſuits and Miſſionaries of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, are Perſons Learned and Subtile, trained up by the moſt expert Maſters, and not ſuffer'd to go abroad, till they are tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly skil'd and inſtructed in the controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies between them and us, and furniſh'd with all manner of Arts and Abilities to ſeduce, and deceive People. And cannot Perſons ſo prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and fitted for it, make groſs errours, and the fouleſt practices look fair and plauſible, varniſh them over ſo with Apologies or Excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, extenuate their guilt, pare off the Abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties adhereing to them with Diſtinctions, and ſet them out to ſuch advantage, that an honeſt Man ſhall not only think them Innocent things, ſuch as have no harm nor venome in them, but be very much enamour'd of or taken with them? They that read their Books muſt acknowledg (if they will ſpeak the truth) that nothing is wanting in them, that either Wit or Zeal can invent, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, or put a fair gloſs upon the errours of their Church: &amp; though what they plead in Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them be falſe or deceitful Argumentations, poor &amp; idle Sophiſms, meer Paint &amp; Varniſh, no better than Gilding a Rotten Poſt, or Cloathing Errour in the dreſs and veſtments of Truth, yet
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:44080:72"/> they ſeem ſo plauſible, look ſo fair and inviting, that a Good, Conſcientious, and well meaning Man (as I ſaid before) may be ſo abus'd, and deluded by them, as to become a Proſelyte to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. And being ſo, is he not a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian? A Papiſt, I ſuppoſe, cannot truly be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd to be a Chriſtian, becauſe the Church, of which he is a Member, is a Chriſtian Church, though lapſed into great Errours and Impieties: a Chriſtian Church it muſt needs be, becauſe it makes Profeſſion of the Faith and Religion of Chriſt, aſcribes enough to him to ſecure to it ſelf the Glorious Title and Denomination of Chriſtian; for the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> in the Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Article of Juſtification, gives this account of it, <hi>Hujus Juſtificationis cauſae ſunt,</hi> &amp;c. <note place="margin">

                  <hi>The Cauſes of this Juſtification are theſe: The Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Cauſe is the Glory of God, and of Chriſt, and Eternal Life. The Efficient Cauſe is the Merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful God, who freely waſheth aod ſanctifieth, ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and anoynting with the Holy Spirit of promiſe, who is the the earneſt of our Inheritance. The Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious cauſe is the moſt beloved, and only begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Son of God, who when we were Enemies, for his great Love wherewith he Loved us, did by his moſt holy paſſion upon the Croſs Merit Juſtification, and give Satisfaction to God his Father for us:</hi> By which it is Evident that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> holds, That the Merits of Chriſt are the moving or procuring Cauſe of our Juſtification, ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary to it, that as that Council ſpeaks a little after, <hi>Nemo poſſit eſſe juſtus niſi cui</hi>

                  <hi>merita Paſſionis Domini noſtri Jeſu Chriſti Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municantur, no Man can be Juſt or Righteous but
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:44080:72"/> He to whom the Merits of the Paſſion of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt are Communicated.</hi> Now they that acknowledg or own this Great and Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Truth, that we are juſtified by the Merits of Chriſt, and conſequently that he is our only Saviour, and do adore him as the Chriſt, or Son of God, which they cannot be deny'd to do, though that Acknowledgment, &amp; this Worſhip of theirs, be mixt and accompany'd with many, and thoſe very dangerous Errours, muſt be acknowledg'd to be a Chriſtian Church: And if the collective Body be ſuch the particular Members muſt be ſo too.</p>
               <p>I ſuppoſe then it will be eaſily granted me, by the greateſt Zealots againſt Popery, (it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but a reaſonable conceſſion, and ſuch as I ſhall not take for a favour to have yeilded to me) That a Papiſt is a Chriſtian, though an Erring one, and then all the diſpute between the <hi>Excluders</hi> and me in the great Caſe before us, comes to this, <hi>Whether an Erring Chriſtian doth by being ſo, Forfeit his Birth-right.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To ſay he doth, is an hard ſaying, and ſuch as can never be Juſtified or Defended; for a Chriſtian, as all other Men may do, may Err either in Judgment, or Practice, or Both. Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour in Judgment, if it reſts there, can forfeit no Mans Right, becauſe it is injurious to none but the Erring Perſon himſelf, and cannot be known to any but the great Searcher of Hearts, and therefore no humane Laws can Puniſh it.</p>
               <p>If any Errour then forfeits a Mans Right, it muſt be Errour in Practice, becauſe this is both
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:44080:73"/> open or manifeſt, and may be miſchievous or hurtful to others: but every Errour in practice (every Sin that is) cannot forfeit a Common or Ordinary Right, much leſs ſo Great, Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent and Extraordinary a Right, as this to a Crown.</p>
               <p>To ſay it can, or doth, is a ſure way to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all Men from being Chriſtians; for who will be ſo, if by doing any Evil Action, he forfeits all his Happineſs in Heaven, and all his Injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Expectations upon Earth? That in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is recoverable by Repentance, but it is uncertain whether any Repentance can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore a Man to theſe, being once forfeited, and as ſuch alienated or taken from him; becauſe 'tis doubtful whether he that hath them in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion will ever reſtore them to the firſt Owner. And therefore no Man, that conſiders the Frailty of his nature, the great and manifold Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to which he is expoſed, and the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and uſefulneſs of that Eſtate or Property (to his comfortable ſubſiſtence in this World) which he hath either acquir'd by his Labour and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, or deſcends to him by Inheritance, will ever be a Chriſtian, if by being ſo, every Sin he commits doth forfeit that Eſtate or Property.</p>
               <p>So Injurious to the moſt Holy and Excellent Religion of Chriſt, and that which tends to the utter Ruin and Deſtruction of it, is that Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally Popiſh, and ſince by Adoption Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian Principle, <hi>That all Dominion is founded in Grace: that no private Perſon hath any Right to his Eſtate or Property, nor any Prince or Monarch to bear Rule or Authority over others, any longer
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:44080:73"/> than he is an Holy and Gracious Perſon, and in the favour of God.</hi> Upon this Principle the Pope proceeds when he Excommunicates, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth Princes, that profeſs the Reformed Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: that Profeſſion in his Opinion makes them Hereticks, and their Perſiſting in it declares them Obſtinate, or ſuch as will not be Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which are (he thinks) two great Sins, to deny that which he calls the Faith, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſtubbornly in that denial, by which (in his Judgment) they forfeit their Royal Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which being lapſed to him, the Supreme Miniſter of Chriſt upon Earth, is abſolutely at his diſpoſal, ſo that he may give it to whom he pleaſeth. Upon this Principle alſo the proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Rebells in the late times ſeiz'd the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the Revenues of it, plunder'd, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſter'd, deprived the Loyal party of their Eſtates, call'd them Malignants, ſay'd they were great Sinners, Perſons either void of, or fallen from all Grace, and being ſo, their Eſtates were forfeited, which they (being the Saints and People of God) might juſtly take poſſeſſion of, and convert to their own uſe. So glad are men Knaviſhly inclin'd of any Religious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence or colour for their Rapines and Injuſtice: but I ſhall endeavour to ſtrip them of this co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering, that it may never more be a Cloak for their Avarice and Oppreſſions.</p>
               <p>That this is a falſe, as well as wicked and miſchievous Principle, may be proved divers <note place="margin">Subſect. 1:</note> ways: For firſt, if now under the Chriſtian Religion, Dominion be founded in Grace, it
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:44080:74"/> muſt be ſo founded by the Decree and Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt himſelf contained in the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, but that gives us no notice nor infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation at all of any ſuch decree or appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his, therefore there is, there can be no ſuch thing. Search all the four Goſpels, and all the Sacred Writings of the Apoſtles, and there will be nothing found in them to countenance or favour ſo wild a Principle. 'Tis true indeed, our Lord hath intermix'd ſome few Temporal promiſes with his great and noble offers of Eternal rewards and injoyments, that our obedience to his excellent Laws might be excited, and encouraged with the expectation both of preſent and future advantages, ſuch is that, when charging his Diſciples not to be too thoughtful or ſolicitous for the things of the Earth, he ſaid, <hi>ſeek ye firſt the Kingdom of God,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">St. <hi>Math. 6. 33.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>and his Righteouſneſs, and all theſe things ſhall be added unto you:</hi> never afflict, nor trouble your ſelves about theſe mean and deſpicable things, let it be your conſtant ſtudy and endeavour to obey my Laws, and to lead the pure and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous lives they injoyn you, and then you may be confident, you ſhall want nothing, either ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary or convenient for you in this World: <hi>he that cloaths the Lillies in ſuch brave and ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did Veſtments, and feeds the young Ravens that cry unto him, will take care of, and extend his Royal Bounty to you his devout Worſhippers, and faithful Servants.</hi> And to this great promiſe, I ſuppoſe the Apoſtle refers, when he ſaith, <hi>That Godlineſs is profitable unto all things, having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the Life that now is, as well as of that which is to come;</hi> but by this promiſe no man
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:44080:74"/> hath any new Right to any Temporal poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which he had not before, but it only aſſures him of Gods Bleſſing, that he will by his graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous providence and bounty ſupply him with all things neceſſary for his preſent ſupport, which may be done by proſpering his labour, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence in an honeſt Calling, or by exciting others to extend their Bounty and Charity to him: but Chriſt doth not ſay, obey my Laws, live up exactly to the Rules of my Religion, and I will inrich you with the Wealth and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates of thoſe men, that either oppoſe my Doctrine, or, if they profeſs, do not obſerve or act according to it; aſſure your ſelves that notwithſtanding all I have done to convert them, many will not believe in me, nor all of them that do, obey me; and the want of Faith in the one, and of Obedience, exact and intire Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience in the other, will forfeit all their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral properties and poſſeſſions, which I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queath as my Royal Donative to you, and to my Saints for ever. Such a Declaration as this would have made it clear, that Dominion is founded in Grace; but he hath ſaid nothing that in the leaſt meaſure looks like any ſuch thing, unleſs that promiſe to the meek, may ſeem to ſome to have an aſpect that way, <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed are the meek for they ſhall inherit the Earth:</hi> The meek are oppoſed to thoſe that are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry and paſſionate, and they are the mild and patient people, that are not eaſily Provoked, not Revengful, Turbulent, nor Seditious, but of a Gentle, Pleaſing, and Complying Temper, <hi>theſe</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>ſhall Inherit the Earth,</hi> ſpend
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:44080:75"/> their days in great tranquillity, be happy in the friendſhip of their Equals, the favour of their Superiours, and the protection of their Governours: every man is, or may be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to injure thoſe that are of ſuch a ſweet and obliging temper: not that this meekneſs gives them a Right to any part of the Earth, or any of the poſſeſſions of it, that belong to others, but preſerves them from many dangers &amp; mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries, which they that have it not, betray &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe themſelves to, renders them patient and contented in all conditions, and will, if con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd with all other Chriſtian Vertues, ſecure to them a bleſſed portion in the Land of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, the Heavenly <hi>Canaan,</hi> of which the Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (which God promiſed to the People of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi>) was but a Type or poor Reſemblance, for of that our Lord here ſpeaks, it being the happy Country which every true Chriſtian de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and ſeeks after, <hi>an Inheritance</hi> (as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> calls it) <hi>incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reſerv'd in Heaven for him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſo far was our Lord from ſaying any thing in favour of this Principle, that he utterly declin'd or refuſed to intermeddle with mens Temporal Rights at all, unleſs it was to ſecure them to the owners; of which we have two remarkable inſtances, one in the man that came and ſaid to him, <hi>Maſter ſpeak to my Brother that</hi>

                  <hi>or a Divider over you?</hi> Thou art miſtaken, I am not come as a Temporal Prince or Judg to give Eſtates or Poſſeſſions to any in this World, but to propoſe an Heavenly Kingdome and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Happineſs to all mankind, and to tell them upon what Terms or Conditions they may obtain them. This, is the great concern I am im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd in, and if thou wilt conſult me herein, I will ſoon give thee full Satisfaction. That the Man who made this Motion had no Right to the Inheritance ſeems Evident to me, both by the ſmart Reprehenſion Chriſt gives him in theſe words, <hi>Man, who made me a Judg, or a Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der over you?</hi> I will not meddle in ſo Unjuſt a thing, as to bid thy Brother divide his Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with thee: and alſo by the Admonition he gives him in the following words, <hi>Take heed</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Verſe 15.</note> 
                  <hi>and Beware of Covetouſneſs, for a Mans Life conſiſteth not in the abundance of the things, which he poſſeſſeth:</hi> Thy deſire of wealth, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to encreaſe thy own by leſſening thy Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Poſſeſſion, is a great Sin in thee, and of ſuch mighty danger, that it ought to be avoided with the higheſt Care and Caution; for though Eſtates and Poſſeſſions are uſeful to ſuſtain Life, yet no Man can prolong his Life, nor make it really the more happy by poſſeſſing Superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Wealth.</p>
               <p>The other Inſtance is the Queſtion propoſed to him, by the <hi>Herodians, What thinkeſt thou? Is it Lawful to give Tribute unto Caeſar?</hi> To <note place="margin">St. <hi>Mat. 22. 17.</hi>

                  <hi>unto Caeſar the things which are Caeſars:</hi> Pay your Prince the Tribute that is due to him, do not defraud or wrong him of any thing that belongs to him, far be it from me to Adviſe or Counſel any to detain the Emperours Right from him,</p>
               <p>If our Lord had deſign'd to found Dominion in Grace, here had been a fit Oppertunity to have done it; for when they ſaid, <hi>Tell us, is it Lawful to give Tribute unto Gaeſar?</hi> He might have reply'd, no, it is not, <hi>Caeſar</hi> is an Infidel or Heathen, or Wicked Man, and as ſuch is fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len from all Dominion, and therefore hath no Right to Demand Tribute of the People, nor they any Obligation upon them to Pay him any: But ſo far was Chriſt from giving them ſuch an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that he Acknowledg'd Tribute to be <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſars</hi> Right, and Commanded it to be pay'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him; and though he was the Son of that God, from whom <hi>Caeſar</hi> receiv'd his Imperial Power and Authority, yet when the Officers Demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it of him, rather than he would deprive him of his Right, he wrought a Miracle, that he might have wherewith to pay it: which ſhews the admirable Juſtice and Integrity of our Lord, in that he was careful to ſecure and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve all Mens Rights and Properties. If any Man refuſed to Submit unto his Excellent Laws, and to come over to his Religion, he told him, he ſhould have no part nor portion in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, but then to avoid miſtakes, he declared that his Kingdom was not of this World, not an Earthly, but an Heavenly Kingdom, and all Right to this he affirms is founded in Grace, that
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:44080:76"/> it is the Free and Royal Gift of God, and the Purchaſe of his Meritorious Holineſs, and Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, there being nothing in Men to Merit ſo great a Good, the things he requires of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neceſſary Diſpoſitions to qualifie, or fit them for the Injoyment of it, not the Cauſe moving God to confer it upon them.</p>
               <p>So that though a Pious and Holy Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be the great Condition of a Crown here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, and ſo abſolutely neceſſary, that it cannot be obtain'd without it: And though it be an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament and Security to him that hath one upon Earth, an Ornament, as it Gives an admirable Luſtre to his Greatneſs, and Renders him Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent in his Perſon, as well as upon the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his Royal Office: A ſecurity, as it In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dears the Providence of God, and Ingages his tender care of him, as it Diſcourages Wicked and Trayterous Men from attempting or enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing any thing againſt him, whoſe Piety makes him Dear to Heaven, renders him ſo highly the Joy and Delight of the Bleſſed An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, that they are Ready to offer themſelves as a Guard and Defence to him; and as it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures him the Love, Honour, and Admiration of all good Men; yet the higheſt Piety or Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs gives no Man a Title to that Dominion or Soveraignty upon Earth, to which he had not an Antecedent Right, nor doth the Want of it deprive him that hath it of that Right Chriſt offers, Indeed an Heavenly Kingdom, upon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of a good Life, but an ill one Forfeits no Mans Right to an Earthly. And ſeeing our Lord hath ſaid nothing in Favour of this Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:44080:77"/> but on their contrary that which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws and deſtroys it, It cannot be true that Dominion is founded in Grace; for he having not founded it ſo, who is the great Law giver to his Church, no humane Authority can do it, without invading his Prerogative, nay (as I obſerv'd before) without deſtroying his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; becauſe Experience ſhews us, moſt Men are mightily byaſſed or led by their Intereſt; for though ſome have been ſuch generous Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of him, as to forſake all to follow him, Houſes, and Lands, and Poſſeſſions, nay, and what were more precious to them their deareſt Lives too, yet to make every Sin a Chriſtian Commits (whilſt he endeavours to Obey his Laws, and to Imitate his Holy Life) through Weakneſs, Ignorance, Surpriſe, or Inadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency to forfeit all his Temporal Rights and Poſſeſſions is to deter or drive all Men from his Religion, to ſcare them from putting their Necks into ſuch a Cruel Yoke, to make them ſuſpect, that under pretence of Saving them hereafter, it intends to Begger and Ruin them here, offers them great things in Reverſion, on purpoſe to cheat them of all they have in Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion. But thanks be to God, though ſome Men for their own Ends are ſo Impious as to teach ſuch Knaviſh Doctrines, yet our Lord is more Juſt and Reaſonable than to Render Mens Temporal Rights ſo Precarious and Uncertain, as the Aſſertors of this Wild Principle would make them.</p>
               <p>Beſides, If we ſuppoſe this Principle to be true (as it is moſt certainly falſe) yet upon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:44080:77"/> Accounts it is not Practicable; For ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it muſt be left to every Mans private Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Opinion who hath Grace, and who hath not, who is a Child of God, and who is not, who is a Saint, and who a Reprobate, and conſequently, he muſt have Power to ſeize the Rights and Properties of thoſe he believes to be Sinners and Wicked Perſons: Or elſe there muſt be ſome publick Judg to Conduct this great Affair, and to Determine or Decide all the Controverſies about it.</p>
               <p>To aſſert the firſt, to make every Man a Judg in the Caſe is Intolerable, the Mother of all miſchief and confuſion, 'tis to ſet all Mankind together by the Ears, or to put them into a State of War: For will not every Man think himſelf a Saint (when it is ſo much for his Gain and Advantage to be ſo perſwaded of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf) and his Neighbour, that hath a better E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, and a fairer Fortune, a Sinner? <hi>Titius</hi> (ſuppoſe) hath large Poſſeſſions and a goodly Heritage, <hi>Sempronius</hi> is Poor, but highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited of his Sanctity, thinks himſelf very Pious Religious, and dear to God, but his Neighbour <hi>Titius</hi> to be a Reprobate, and Gods Enemy, and upon that Preſumption ſeizes or poſſeſſes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of his Eſtate: <hi>Valerius</hi> ſeeing what <hi>Sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pronius</hi> had done, and Judging it a ready way to get Wealth, Entertains the ſame Thoughts of him, and Treats him as he did <hi>Titius; Fabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> being a Spectator of theſe Practices, ſmiles and takes the next turn, ſets upon <hi>Valerius,</hi> and forces the Rich Booty out of his hands: And ſo they run on in an endleſs Circle of Cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:44080:78"/> and Robbing one another, and turn the World into a Den of Holy and Religious Theeves: A place ſo miſerable, that no good Man could have any Temptation to ſtay in it, or elſe becauſe he cannot Dye Innocently when he will, be forced to exchange Cities for Woods and Deſerts, and the Society of Men for the Company of Beaſts, as the better &amp; more Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Creatures. So miſchievous to Humane Society, ſo Deſtructive of all Juſtice and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty, ſo Productive of all Confuſion and Diſorder, is it to make every Man a Judg in the Caſe, and to inveſt him with Power to ſeize the Rights and Properties of thoſe he thinks to be void of Grace and Godlineſs.</p>
               <p>To ſay there muſt be a publick Judg to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage this great Affair, and to Determine all the Controverſies about it, is to talk Idly; for ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt hath appointed no ſuch Judg or Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer, who ſhall chuſe or give him Commiſſion ſo to be? The People? Alas the Major part of them have no Grace themſelves, and therefore if they had any Right to chuſe ſuch an Officer, their being fallen from Grace, and Sinners in many Inſtances, Forfeits that Right: But ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe all the People to be Holy, (though they never were, never will be ſo) how ſhall they know which of all the numerous Competitors that ſtand for ſo great and gainful an Office, hath Grace, and is a Child of God? he whom they think a Sheep may be a Wolf in Sheeps Cloathing, the Man they ſuppoſe to be a Dove may be a Vulture, and he whom they take for an Angel of Light, may prove a Devil. The
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:44080:78"/> Hearts of Men are known to none but God; the People therefore (if they were allowed to chuſe this great Officer) can only Judg of him according to Appearance, by the Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Religion and Holineſs he makes, and by his outward Actions and Behaviour, which may be wholly Feigned and Hypocritical; for will not the greateſt Rogue in the World look as Demure, talk as Godly, ſeem as Holy as ever he can, whilſt he ſtands Candidate for ſo profitable an Imploy, if he do it not, he is a very ſilly Wretch.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe then this great Judg or Officer to be choſen, Being inveſted he is either a Graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and Holy Perſon, or not: If not, his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection is Null or Void; becauſe he holds his new imploy by Grace, which being deſtitute of, as ſoon as it appears by any Evil or Sinful Action his Office is void, and the Perſons concern'd muſt proceed to a new Election. But if on the other ſide the Perſon Elected be really Holy and Religious, when this Office is confer'd upon him (though that cannot be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly known) yet there is no aſſurance that he will continue ſo; for he may either fall into Perſonal Sins, or abuſe his Truſt by paſſing wrong Judgment, by a Falſe or Erroneus Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence he may Condemn them as Graceleſs and Wicked Men, that are truly Holy and Religious, and ſo deprive them of their Rights and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties wrongfully, or call them Gracious and Pious Perſons that only ſeem ſo, and adjudg thoſe Poſſeſſions to them, which they have no Right to. For doth he pronounce them Saints
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:44080:79"/> and the Children of God, whoſe outward Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Demeaner appear to be agreeable to the Laws of Chriſt? This may be a great mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake, becauſe thoſe may be pure Diſſimulation, meer Hypocritical paint and varniſh, for a cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and wary Hypocrite will ſo Perſonate or Act the part of a Saint (eſpecially when it will be ſo Beneficial to him as this Principle makes it) that the moſt watchful and ſtrict ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver ſhall not be able, at leaſt of a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able time, to diſcover or find him out. And how Abominable is it to Rob one Sinner to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich Another? to take from him that Misbeha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved himſelf, or did an Evil Action, that Eſtate and thoſe Poſſeſſions, which he either acquired by his Labour and Induſtry, or deſcended to him by Inheritance, and give them to a diſſemb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Knave, that is careful only to ſeem, but deſires not to be Holy and Religious. He may Err too in the Sentence he paſſes upon Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, for thoſe he takes to be Reprobates, may be the Children of God, and the Evil Actions he ſuppoſes to be Mortal and Hainous Sins, may be the Spots of Sons, and proceed not from a Total Deſtitution or Want, but from weakneſs of Grace, they may be Slips and Frailties, not wilful or deliberate Crimes, though they ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times enſnare and ſurpriſe him, yet the Man may heartily Abhor, Repent of, and Strive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, be earneſtly Labouring after that habitual Holineſs, and proficiency in Piety and Vertue, that will in time render him Victorious over all Sin, and Wickedneſs. What horrid In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury is it then to ſuch a Child of God as this
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:44080:79"/> (that heartily Loves his Heavenly Father, and ſincerely endeavours to do his Will) to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn him as a Reprobate, and as ſuch to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive him of all the Poſſeſſions he hath upon Earth?</p>
               <p>So that if any Sect, or Society of Men had Power to Elect ſuch a Judg or Officer, unleſs when they have choſe, they can make him In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, or give him Unerring (that is) Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Wiſdom, ſtill they would be never the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; becauſe he could not Execute his Office without committing the groſſeſt, moſt miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous and pernicious Errours and Miſtakes, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out paſſing ſuch Sentences as will Condemn and Ruine the Innocent, and on the other ſide Juſtifie and Enrich the Guilty and the Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>I know indeed that thoſe two great Rivals, who claim a Right of Judging in the Caſe, that is the Pope and Presbytery, do both pretend to be Infallible, the firſt Directly or in Expreſs words, the other by Conſequence: As for the Pope he profeſſes to have an Infallible or Uner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Judgment in all Caſes, and the Presbytery ſay they have the Spirit, which is to ſay the ſame thing his Holineſs doth, though in other Terms: Now here being two Parties contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for this Judicature, and both of them, for the due managing of it, pretending to be Infallible, and neither of them willing to quit their Claim or Title, or to reſign it to the other, the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is, Which of them muſt be acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Judg in the Caſe? The Presbytery are Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently the Younger, and but of Yeſterday in
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:44080:80"/> compare with the other; for the Pope will plead that ſeveral General Councils have own'd and aſſerted him to be the ſupreme Judg, upon Earth, in all Cauſes belonging to Religion, but the Presbytery can alledg no ſuch thing, never had any Council to declare for them, unleſs they will be ſo Preſumptuous as to call the ſneaking Synod of <hi>Dort</hi> ſo. And therefore till one of theſe Pretenders Renounce his claim, there can be no ſupreme or ſole Judg in the Caſe, and to place this Judicature in them both, would make mad work; becauſe the Pope hath adjudged the Presbytery to be Hereticks, and therefore void of Grace, and conſequently ſuch as have no Right to Judg in the Caſe. And the Presbytery on the other ſide call the Pope Antichriſt and Man of Sin, and the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> over which he preſides, the Great Whore, the Whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and therefore not only fallen from, but paſt all Grace: And thoſe whom he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares to be Saints and good Catholicks, they pronounce to be Reprobates, or Sinners of the firſt Magnitude: Thoſe alſo whom he calls Hereticks, and Anathematizes as the moſt Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitious Criminals upon Earth, they admire and cry up as the Peculiar People &amp; Dear Children of God. So that if the Accuſations and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictments, they prefer one againſt another, be true, they are both ſuch Impious Graceleſs Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that they are not capable of being Judges in the Caſe, and the groſs and abominable Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours both of them are ſo Notoriouſly Guilty of, Shame, and Prove the Infallibility they both
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:44080:80"/> lay claim to, to be a moſt inſolent and lying Pretence.</p>
               <p>And being neither taught in Scripture nor Practicable in it ſelf, this Principle muſt needs be falſe, and the Invention of Cheats, who ſay as the <hi>Gnoſticks</hi> did of old, <hi>That Gain is Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> If Chriſt had founded Dominion in Grace, he would have inſerted this degree amongſt his other Laws, which his Bleſſed Apoſtles have Tranſmitted to us in their inſpired Writings, but there is no mention of any ſuch thing, and he having not ſo founded it, no Authority upon Earth can do it: And becauſe he took Care by his Strict and Excellent precepts of Juſtice to preſerve and ſecure Mens Rights and Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as they can be none of his Diſciples, that Violate and Invade them, ſo upon what Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence ſoever they do it, they muſt expect the dreadful Puniſhment, which his Laws De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce againſt the Unjuſt &amp; the Oppreſſours; and therefore I conclude, That Dominion is not <note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>And if Dominion be not founded in Grace then a Chriſtian may Err in Practice, (that is) do ſome Evil things and not forfeit his Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Right or Property, be it Ordinary or Extraordinary, a Right to a private Eſtate, or as this under debate, to ſucceed to the Royal Dignity.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The Crimes therefore that Forfeit a Mans Right, muſt be ſuch as are Deſtructive of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Society, which are Thefts, Murders, and Treaſons: But then he that commits theſe, or any of them, doth by our Laws Forfeit his Life as well as Eſtate: the Royal Clemency in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, may if it ſees Cauſe, Pardon thoſe that Commit theſe great Offences, which Pardon Reſtores them intirely to all they had Forfeited, but without that they are Dead, and Deprived
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:44080:81"/> of all their Poſſeſſions by Law: It being Juſt that he who ſteals another Mans Goods, ſhould looſe his own, that he who will not let his Neighbour Live to Enjoy his Eſtate, ſhould Forfeit both his Life and Eſtate, and that he or they who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt any thing againſt the Sacred and moſt Precious Life of their Prince, be not only Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd as the higheſt Malefactors, by a Death peculiar to ſuch execrable Criminals, but that they ſuffer in their Poſterity too, thoſe that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend from them not being permitted to enjoy their Eſtates, but that they be Vagabonds and Miſerable in the Earth, thar others may ſee and fear, and not dare to do ſo Wickedly, as to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel or Conſpire againſt their Prince. There are in all Ages all Places of the World ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate Villains that can be content to venture their own Lives, if they can but Imbroyl Kingdoms, and Aſſaſſinate or Murder Princes; and therefore it is Juſt that not only Death, but Forfeiture of Eſtates and all their Poſſeſſions be the Puniſhment of Traitors, becauſe this will many times Reſtrain thoſe from ſuch Deteſtable Practices, which that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deter them from, for they that are ſo mad as not to care for their own Lives, will yet be ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of their Innocent Children, &amp; take heed how they Ruin them.</p>
               <p>Thefts then, and Murders, and Treaſons are ſuch Errours in Practice, as Forfeit both the Lives and Properties of thoſe that commit them; becauſe theſe Crimes are ſo pernicious that if they be not Puniſh'd with ſuch Severity, they will Ruine or Deſtroy any State or Society;
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:44080:82"/> for no Man could enjoy his Life or Eſtate, &amp; there would be no Peace nor Government, but continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Oppreſſions, Wars, Murders, Tumults, &amp; Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which muſt needs Ruin or lay any Kingdom Waſte.</p>
               <p>And if theſe be all the Crimes that Forfeit Mens Rights and Properties, his Royal Highneſs cannot have Forfeited his Right of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, becauſe he is ſo Innocent from all theſe, that his greateſt Enemies (the <hi>Excluders</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) have not laid any of them to his Charge.</p>
               <p>Suppoſing then the Duke to be a Papiſt, that is, an Erring Chriſtian, yet that making no Forfeiture of his Right, To take it from him is to Oppreſs and Ruin an Innocent Prince, and therefore the higheſt and moſt execrable Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice: To Rob a mean Perſon of his Right is Theft and Knavery, to Deprive a Prince (in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance of all the Laws of Heaven and Earth, of God and Men) of ſuch a Treaſure as a Crown, of ſuch an Inheritance as a Kingdom, nay as three Kingdoms, is ſo great an Injury or Oppreſſion, that I want words to expreſs it.</p>
               <p>To ſay the <hi>Bill of Excluſion</hi> is Cautionary or Preventive, deſign'd to Diſable a Popiſh Prince from doing the Miſchiefs, which as ſuch he may do, if he gets into the Throne, inſtead of mend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the matter makes it worſe, this being to Puniſh a Prince with great, if not the higheſt Severity, not for doing things meriting ſuch a Puniſhment, but for fear he ſhould do them, which is a new ſort of Juſtice, and ſuch as was never before heard of in the Chriſtian World, and can be no where match'd unleſs it be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:44080:82"/> the Turks, where the Cuſtom is for the new <hi>Sultan</hi> to ſtrangle his Brothers, for fear if they were ſuffer'd to Live, they ſhould Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire againſt, and Attempt to take the Empire from him. This ſort of Juſtice, if it was pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued to all the purpoſes to which it equally ſerves, would make mad work in the World, fill it full of Violence and Cruel Practices; for by the ſame Reaſon they may deprive Honeſt Men of their Rights, their Eſtates and Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, not becauſe they have already, but becauſe they may hereafter put them to Ill and Dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous uſes. The old Juſtice is a dull and ſlow thing in Compare with this, That ſtays, till Men have Offended, or Committed things worthy of Puniſhment, and then it Strikes, but This is ſo Quick and Expeditious that it Puniſhes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they have Tranſgreſs'd, Draws out the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying Sword, not only before a Man be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed, but before he be Guilty; than which way of Proceeding nothing can be more Impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and Unrighteous, and conſequently more to be Abhor'd, Execrated, &amp; Avoided by every one that pretends either to Common Honeſty, or Chriſtian Piety. For to ſay as the Men of the New Morals do, That a bare Suſpicion of Injury from another makes it Juſt, or Lawful to diſable the Perſon ſo ſuſpected, to do it, is to expoſe the Lives and Eſtates of the moſt Innocent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to the Avarice and Cruelty of every Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpitious Villain, that hath Power or Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to invade them: For the more Wicked any Man is, the more Suſpicious he muſt needs be, That being the inſeperable Companion of Guilt:
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:44080:83"/> And if this Maxime be admited, it will Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate him that receives it to the moſt Savage Practiſes, Encourage him with <hi>Solomons</hi> Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to caſt Fire-Brands, Arrows and Death, to Murder this, Rob that Man, and Undo a third, and to repeat ſuch Outrages as often as he can, and all this, becauſe he is ſuch a Rogue as to Suſpect, without any Ground or Reaſon at all, that the firſt will kill, the ſecond rifle, the third ruin him. Upon this Principle a Prince may ſeize the Eſtates, and cut the Throats of all his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, whom he ſuſpects to be Diſaffected to him, and the People Beggar and Butcher one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother as often as they pleaſe. And then 'tis in vain to talk of Government, or Laws, or humane Society, This being a perfect ſtate of War, to lay aſide that Mercy and Juſtice which are both the Ornament and Happineſs of Men, and to put on the Fierceneſs and Barbarity of the moſt Savage Beaſts: 'Tis not then injury Suſpected, but Acted, the having Done wrong to another, not his Fear or Apprehenſion that it will be done, that makes a Man juſtly Puniſhable.</p>
               <p>And I cannot more Effectually ſhame, and <note place="margin">Subſect the 3d.</note> reprove this new Juſtice, than by Comparing it with ſome of the Principles of the Chriſtian Religion (of which we all make Profeſſion) deliver'd to us by our Lord and his Apoſtles. With that great Precept of Juſtice, <hi>All things whatſoever ye would that Men ſhould do</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">St. Mat. 7. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>unto you do ye even ſo to them:</hi> This is ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and equal a Rule for us to act by in all our Intercourſe and Dealings with others, that
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:44080:83"/> it was admir'd and applauded by the very Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, the Emperour <hi>Severus</hi> was ſo pleaſed with it, that he had it often in his Mouth, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verenc'd the Chriſtian Religion, and the Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Author of it for the ſake of this Precept. Had our Lord ſaid, do all things that are Juſt, he had given indeed a General Rule, Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending all the Special Precepts of the Law of Nature, but he had ſaid nothing by which we <note place="margin">Eſpiſcopius in locum.</note> might have certainly known, what in all Affairs and Tranſactions is Juſt, but when he ſaid, <hi>All things whatſoever ye would that Men ſhould do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, do ye even ſo to them,</hi> he gave us ſuch a Rule, by which in every Caſe and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance we may be ſure, what is Juſt; for as we cannot doubt what we would have others do to us, ſo neither can we doubt what we our ſelves ought to do to others: Every Man in his Wits, would receive no Injury or Wrong from others, but Injoy his Life and Eſtate, all his Rights and Properties, without Dammage &amp; Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution, and therefore he muſt offer no Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to any Man, nor attempt to Diſpoſſeſs, or Deprive him of any thing that belongs to him.</p>
               <p>Every Man would have others deal fairly and ſincerely, keep their word and promiſe with him, not Circumvent nor deceive him with <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Id. Inſtit. Theol:</hi> lib. 4: pa. 249.</note> lies, fraud, or falſehood, pay him what is due to him, or if he owe another any thing, he would not have him be rigorous or ſevere with him, but forbear or allow him ſome time, till he be able to pay him, if he be in any Want or Miſery, he would be Relieved and Aſſiſted by
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:44080:84"/> the Counſel, Help, Comfort, and Prayers of others, and therefore is obliged to do all theſe things to others.</p>
               <p>And this Rule extends to all Orders and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Men, Superiours, Equals, and Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours: They that have any Superiority over o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, expect from them the Honour and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience due to them, and therefore muſt pay the ſame Reſpect and Submiſſion to thoſe that are poſſeſs'd of an higher Station. Every Man looks for Friendſhip and Fidelity from his Equals, and conſequently muſt be Kind and Faithful to them. They that are Inferiour to, and have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Dependence upon others, would Injoy their Favour, Clemency, and good Will, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from them Help, Relief, and Counſel in their need, and therefore muſt afford the ſame to thoſe that are Below, and Depend upon them. He that is a Magiſtrate, if he were a a Private Perſon would be protected both in his Life and Eſtate, have no Man ſuffer'd to do him Wrong or Violence with Impunity, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt ſo diſcharge his Office, and behave himſelf to all Men that come to him for Juſtice. So that this one Rule gives us full and ſufficient Direction how to Order all our Intercourſe, and Dealings with Men, that they may be Juſt and Equal. And if the greateſt Zealots for, and Admirers of it, will pleaſe to Compare their Project of <hi>Excluſion</hi> with this Excellent Rule or Law of Chriſt, they will ſoon perceive the High and Horrid Injuſtice of it. Do they Treat, or do to his Royal Highneſs as they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves would be done to? Would any one of
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:44080:84"/> them be content to be depriv'd of his Birth-right meerly upon the Account of his Religion? No, ſo far are they from being willing to be ſo uſed themſelves, that to prevent or take away all poſſibility of it, they would deprive the Duke of his Inheritance: They Love themſelves ſo well, that they would not Suffer at all, have no Harm nor Danger happen to them, their Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred to his Royal Highneſs is ſo Cruel and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable, that they would make Him Suffer the greateſt Wrong and Dammage. To make a true Judgment in the Caſe, <hi>Mutanda eſt Perſona</hi> the Perſon muſt be changed: Let then the Fierceſt and moſt Zealous of the <hi>Excluders</hi> ſuppoſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the Dukes Place, that he was Heir to ſuch a Jewel as a Crown, to ſo Rich and Valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able an Inheritance as three Kingdoms are, and that he had done nothing, which either by any Divine or Humane Law yet extant, made a Forfeiture of that Right and Inheritance, and that thoſe whom he had never Injured, or of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd any Juſt Offence to, were Confederate againſt him, and contended with all their Zeal and Induſtry to have a Law made to Bar his Claim, and Deprive him of the Poſſeſſion of it, if it ſhould by courſe of Nature deſcend to him, how would he take ſuch uſage? What would he think of them that Treated him ſo? would he not fill Heaven and Earth with his Complaints? Cry out that Juſtice and Honeſty had left the World, and Appeal to Heaven for Succour, ſaying with the Royal Prophet, <hi>Help me Lord, for there is not one Godly Man left, for</hi>

And if theſe would be his Thoughts and Reſentments of ſuch uſage, when offer'd to himſelf, how abominably Wicked and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt is it for him and his Brethren to offer it to the Duke? This is apparently to Contemn and Violate this moſt equal, and therefore excellent Law of Chriſt, to do that to another which they would be moſt impatient of, if done to themſelves.</p>
               <p>Our Laws indeed Puniſh all ſorts of Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants, but then the Puniſhments they Inflict are Moderate, intended to Reform, not Ruin them: they deprive none of them of their <hi>Birth-right,</hi> and all their Poſſeſſions, but only of ſome part of them, and thoſe Puniſhments are Juſt, and agreeable to this Rule, becauſe they offer that Contempt and Diſturbance to the Government, which if they were in Authority, they would not have others do to them. 'Tis certain that neither Popery nor Presbytery, where they are Eſtabliſh'd, will give Toleration to any that Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from them; and if they will grant none to others, with what Face can they expect it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves? Beſides tis Evident that both theſe Fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:44080:85"/> both formerly, and of late, have prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis'd againſt the State, been guilty of horrid Treaſons and Seditions, Murder'd the Glorious Father, (to go no higher) Plotted the Death and Deſtruction of the moſt Excellent Son, our preſent moſt Gracious Soveraign, which is the higheſt Violation of this Sacred Law of Chriſt; for would any of them, if he was King of theſe Nations, be content to be ſo uſed, as they Treat their Prince? would he be willing to have his Subjects take Arms againſt, and Conſpire his Death? when he had given them all manner of Demonſtrations of his Love and Care of them, ſought to Oblige &amp; Indear them by a Juſt, Merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, &amp; Peaceable Government? would he take it well to ſee them requite his high Affection with deadly Hatred, his tender care with contempt, his Royal Mercy &amp; Juſtice, with Barbarous Cruelty &amp; Villany? yet theſe things, this hard meaſure, have both the Papiſts &amp; Fanaticks offer'd to their Prince, and therefore the Puniſhments which our Laws inflict upon them are Juſt, &amp; they have no Cauſe of complaint againſt the Government; becauſe it Corrects them with Mercy and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, Puniſhes them leſs than their Crimes Deſerve. 'tis Death indeed by our Law, for any of the Romiſh Prieſts and Jeſuits to be found in <hi>England,</hi> but that Puniſhment is not inflicted on them for their Religion, but for their Irreligion and Wickedneſs, their frequent and execrable Treaſons, their reſtleſs attempts againſt their Lives and Government, awaken'd and made it neceſſary for our Kings by Capital Puniſhments to deter ſuch Traytors &amp; Murderers
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:44080:86"/> from entring their Dominions, who came upon the moſt Bloudy and Miſchievous deſigns, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Aſſaſſinate their ſacred Perſons, or to Seduce their People from their Allegiance, and Animate them to Rebell or take Arms againſt them. And therefore if the Romiſh Prieſts and Jeſuites, who have nothing to do here, will ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to come, they can blame none but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>themſelves, if they ſuffer for it, they receive the Reward of their Sin and Folly, but have no Injuſtice done them: If they ſtay away they are ſafe, but if they will Run into Danger when they need not, they Deſtroy themſelves, fall into the Pit, are taken in the Snare, which they came to dig, and lay for their Prince, whoſe Natural Subjects they are, though they become Voluntary Vaſſals to a Forreign Power, that imploys them againſt their own Prince, for whoſe Safety and Preſervation, they ought by all Laws both Divine and Humane, to expoſe themſelves to the greateſt Dangers, freely Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture their own Lives to ſave his.</p>
               <p>And ſeeing the <hi>Excluders</hi> attempt, and would do that to his Royal Highneſs, which our Laws do to no Ordinary Subject, meerly for his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and which they would not have done to themſelves, that attempt muſt needs be a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt Affront to, and Violation of this Law of Chriſt, and therefore moſt Wicked and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt.</p>
               <p>To ſay they are of the true, and the Duke (as a Papiſt) of the falſe Religion, makes no difference in the Caſe, becauſe Chriſt excepts no Man, but Commands us to do to Men Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:44080:86"/> that is to all Men, whether they be Orthodox, or otherwiſe, believe Aright, or Err from the Truth, Chriſtians or Heathens, <hi>All things whatſoever we would that they ſhould do unto us.</hi> And alſo becauſe no Man that owns the Principles of Natural Religion, that believes there is a God, &amp; Eternal Rewards &amp; Puniſhments after this Life, will be a Diſciple of that, which he is perſwaded is a falſe Religion, and Renders the Salvation of them that are of it hazardous and doubtful; and ſeeing he thinks the Church and Religion he is of, to be true, and the beſt, though he be deceiv'd and thinks amiſs, 'tis to lay aſide both the Juſtice and Mercy, our Lord Requires of us, to Treat ſuch a Perſon with the Rigour and Severity, which the <hi>Exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> offer to his Royal Highneſs, becauſe he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the beſt Light he hath, his Conſcience, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſtructed by Scripture, explain'd and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd (as he apprehends) by Right Reaſon; for 'tis certain a Man can uſe but his beſt care in the choice of his Religion, that is, he can but Pray, and Read, and Meditate, and Obey, as far as he underſtands, and Conſult the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or Adviſe with thoſe he thinks beſt able to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect him: but becauſe all the Learned of the World are not of one Opinion, he muſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy his Reaſon to Judg which of them is in the Right, and if he do it ſincerely, though he chuſes amiſs, miſtakes his way, yet he is to be Pitied, not Ruin'd, to be Reſtored in the Spirit of Meekneſs, not Degraded nor Undone for following his Conſcience. God (tis certain) will be Merciful to a Chriſtian ſo Erring, and
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:44080:87"/> therefore if Men be extreme to Mark what ſuch an one doth amiſs, they Treat him as they would not be uſed themſelves, and ſo bid De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance to this great Law of Chriſt, <hi>all things whatſoever ye would that Men ſhould do unto you, do ye even ſo unto them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Compare it Secondly with that Noble Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of our Lord, which requires all Chriſtians to Love their Enemies, and you will ſoon ſee the Impiety of it, <hi>I ſay unto you, Love your Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi>

But your Charity (if it may be ſo called) would make the Duke ſuffer, and that moſt unjuſtly, that you may not do it your ſelves, would lay the moſt into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable Burthen and Oppreſſion upon him, that you may bear nothing your ſelves; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is unkind and cruel, ſeeketh your own ſafety by his ruin, your own gain and benefit by his loſs and injury, is ſo highly provoked upon bare ſuſpicions and fears as not only to think and imagine, but to attempt and indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to do him the greateſt evil or wrong that can be offer'd to him.

Is this juſt and equal? Is this Chriſtian practiſe, firſt to ſuſpect or ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a Prince to be your Enemy, and then

You ſhould have ſtay'd till his Royal Highneſs had declared himſelf your Enemy, made it appear he Hated you by ſome Injurious or Unjuſt action, and when he had done it, you ſhould not have ſuffered your ſelves to have been overcome with Evil, but have endeavour'd to overcome that Evil with Good: You ſhould have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member'd what our Lord here requires of you, and ſeeing you profeſs your ſelves his Servants and Diſciples, have done accordingly; for this New Way of loving your Enemy, by prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a <hi>Bill of Excluſion</hi> againſt him, that is, by attempting to ruin him, is ſuch a Token or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of your Love ſuch a Pledg of your Kindneſs to him, that the Duke hath no reaſon to thank you for it, and is I am ſure none of that love which our Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires us to bear to our Enemies.

This Love, if the Primitive Chriſtians had been acquainted with it, would have ſaved abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of their Lives, but alas tis New and of Ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterday, and therefore was not known nor heard of in their Days: The good Men Pray'd for their Enemies, Implor'd the Divine Goodneſs to Convert and Forgive them, patiently endured the Wrongs and Cruelties they offer'd them, like their Deareſt Lord and Maſter, <hi>when they were Reviled, they Reviled not again, when they Suffer'd they Threatned not, but Committed themſelves to him that Judgeth Righteouſly:</hi> or as St <hi>Paul</hi> deſcribes their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour <note place="margin">1 Cor. 4. 12, 13.</note> towards their Enemies, <hi>being Reviled we Bleſs, being Perſecuted we Suffer it, being De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famed we Intreat:</hi> Not a word in all this of a <hi>Bill of Excluſion</hi> to Tame the Fierceneſs, Reſtrain the Cruelty of their Enemies, and take from them all Power to hurt them, this is the New Mode of Loving Enemies, or rather themſelves. Speak the Truth then (as the old ſaying is) &amp; ſhame the Devil! Why ſhould you diſſemble with the World? 'Tis Evident you have no Kindneſs for the Duke, but as Plain as any thing can be, that you Love your

It is indeed both Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and Lawful for Men to Love themſelves, but then they muſt ſo manage and conduct that Love, that it be without Injury or Harm to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that whilſt they are Kind to themſelves, they be not Cruel and Unjuſt to, and thereby Haters of their Neighbour, as you prove your ſelves to be by this Project of <hi>Excluſion;</hi> and therefore call it, what it really is, not Chriſtian Charity, but Injurious Emnity or Hatred: You would be aſham'd (I believe) to Love all the other Papiſts, (which as ſuch are your Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies as well as the Duke, ſuppoſing him to be one) in this manner, to Love them ſo as to deprive them of their Birth-Rights; If not, this would Increaſe the Number of your Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and make them more Deſperate and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable againſt you, but it would be no Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion or Token of any true kindneſs to them, and if this be the Love which our Lord requires all Chriſtians to ſhew to their Enemies, they would have thought themſelves more beholden to him, if he had Commanded them to Hate, rather than to Love them in this manner.</p>
               <p>Conſider it Thirdly, in Reference to that great Duty, which our Lord makes the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of our being his Servants or Diſciples, <hi>If any Man will come after me, let him deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and take up his Croſs, and follow me.</hi> If a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Man will be a Chriſtian, he muſt Renounce or Deny every thing that offers to tempt or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade

               <p>Hereby alſo they gain'd great Honour to themſelves, render'd their names and memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries precious and immortal; for the Church was careful to do all Lawfull honour to the Saints or Martyrs, to thoſe brave and worthy Perſons, who living ſhin'd as lights in the World by their Exemplary vertues, and dying ſealed the truth of Chriſtianity with their Blood, had that ardent love for our Lord, that no dangers, nor ſufferings, nor torments, nor miſeries, could leſſen or overcome that Zeal for his Religion, which no Injuries, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, nor Perſecutions could Extinguiſh. The Chriſtians uſed to meet at the place where ſuch eminent Perſons Suffer'd for the Faith, or where their Bodies, that were Slain for the Teſtimony of Jeſus, were Interr'd, and make Orations in praiſe of them, commemorate their piety and ſufferings, praiſe God for the
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:44080:95"/> excellent gifts and graces he confer'd upon them, and Exhort one another to tranſcribe or imitate their Faith, and Piety, and Patience.</p>
               <p>But this was the leaſt and meaneſt Part of their Reward, for as by Sufferings for Chriſt, they gain'd Honour in this, ſo a brighter Crown and greater Rewards in the other World; for it is Evident that our Lord in the Words I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned before, declares <hi>that they which are Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted for Righteouſneſs Sake, ſhall not only have a Reward, but a great Reward in the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> which muſt in Reaſon ſignifie ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than other Chriſtians have, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they that are not, would be as Bleſſed, as they that are Perſecuted, nay more Happy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they would (without being Miſerable in this) obtain Crowns as Glorious, and Rewards as great as they in the other World: the Apoſtle alſo Affirms, <hi>It is a Faithful ſaying, if we be</hi>

<pb n="158" facs="tcp:44080:96"/> ſuch a tranſcendent Reward, and ſo admirable or illuſtrious an Exaltation: This will Teach him to Reckon with St. <hi>Paul, That the Sufferings of this preſent time, are not Worthy to be compared</hi>

               </p>
               <p>And as the Holy Scriptures make ſuch High and Noble Offers to all that Suffer for Chriſt, ſo 'tis certain the Primitive Church (which was the beſt Expounder of Scripture) thought the Martyrs had a greater Reward than other Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Chriſtians, an Additional Coronet over and above the great Crown of Righteouſneſs, and accordingly St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſpeaks of two <note place="margin">Epiſt.

                  <hi>the Sun, and another Glory of the Moon, and another Glory of the Stars; for one Star dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth from another Star in Glory, ſo alſo is the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the Dead:</hi> And if there be different Rewards after this Life, it is Reaſonable to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Bleſſed Martyrs have the moſt ſpark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Crowns, and the biggeſt Recompence in the Glorious Regions above, becauſe they gave the higheſt Teſtimony of their Love and Zeal for Chriſt, by Dying for him.</p>
               <pb n="159" facs="tcp:44080:96"/>
               <p>'Tis not then ſo Miſerable and Deſpicable a thing, as the <hi>Excluders</hi> think it, to take up the Croſs and follow Jeſus, to ſuffer all manner of Injuries, Oppreſſions, Miſeries, nay Death it ſelf for his Sake, becauſe he hath Promis'd great Rewards to them that do it, and having all Power both in Heaven and Earth, he muſt needs be able to accompliſh, or make good that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. 'Tis true indeed, no Man ought to part with his Life, or Eſtate, when he can keep them Innocently; He Suffers as a Fool that doth it, when there is no Danger of Sinning, if he Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer not; But to uſe any Unjuſt or Sinful Arts to free our ſelves from Suffering, ſuch as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of <hi>Excluſion</hi> is, muſt needs be highly Impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and Unchriſtian. For Gods Sake let us keep to the ſame Laws of Chriſt, do the thing that is Right, and leave the reſt to his Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and Gracious Providence; then if we Suffer, our Innocence will be our Comfort and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, and we ſhall have the Bleſſed hope of paſſing by Death to the Rich and moſt Happy Inheritance provided for us in Heaven. Let us Labour to be good, to lead the Pure and Pious Lives our Religion requires of us, and then we can have no Juſt Cauſe to Tremble or be Affraid to Dye: <hi>The Living</hi> (ſaith Solomon) <hi>know that they muſt Dye, and that they can by no Art or Means avoid it:</hi> And ſeeing we muſt do it, can we ever Dye more Honourably, Bravely, and Chriſtianly, than for owning the Holy Faith and Religion of our Dear Redeemer, who gave himſelf to Death, the moſt bitter and ſhameful Death of the Croſs for us? So that
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:44080:97"/> we have his Example to invite, the Noble Army of Martyrs to animate or encourage, and the great Rewards they are poſſeſs'd of to ingage us patiently to bear the Croſs, when our Lord is pleaſed to ſend it.</p>
               <p>'Tis certain that as the Laws now are, no Man can be deprived either of his Life or Eſtate, meerly for profeſſing the Reform'd Religion; &amp; therefore whilſt they continue we are as ſafe and ſecure as we can deſire to be: So that till they are chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, no Man can Suffer for that, and it will be a very difficult undertaking to change them, becauſe the Laws in Favour of our Religion cannot be Aboliſh'd, or taken Off, but by conſent of Parliament, and it will be no eaſie thing for a Popiſh Prince (if at any time ſuch an one comes to the Crown) to get a Parliament that will do it, becauſe the Knights and Burgeſſes that ſerve in Parliament (without whoſe conſent, according to our preſent Conſtitution, no Laws can be either Made or Aboliſh'd) are not choſe by the Prince, but by the People, who are ſo far from Electing Papiſts, that they are too prone to Chuſe Men of the other Dangerous extreme, and ſo Ruin us that way. But if ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Prince ſhould by his writ Summon, or the People ſo forget themſelves as to Elect any Papiſts, yet when they are ſo Call'd and Elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they cannot Sit (as the Laws now are) till they have openly, and in the moſt ſolemn man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner Renounced their Religion, which no Men of any Honour or Conſcience will do: If it be ſaid they may have Diſpenſations from his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs to take any Oaths, and make any Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:44080:97"/> to Capacitate them to Sit in Parliament, I Demand of them that ſay ſo, why the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Lords, who left the Houſe upon that Act, did not make uſe of that Expedient to evade the Law? there is no queſtion but they might have had Diſpenſations to do it, and therefore their leaving the Houſe ſatisfies me, that they thought no Diſpenſations could Warrant, or make it Lawful for them, ſo to Renounce and Abjure their Religion. We are as ſafe then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready as Laws can make us, and they that are ſo buſie to get new ones, trouble themſelves to no purpoſe, for if thoſe we have at preſent cannot ſecure our Religion, no other can do it. Whilſt the Laws then continue as they are (and for my part I do not apprehend how they can be changed) we cannot Suffer, but if theſe (that are a Safe-guard and Defence to us) be at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny time Removed, and the Bloody Laws in Favour of the Romiſh Church Reſtored, we muſt be content, as the Ancient and Modern Martyrs have done before us, to Suffer for the Truth, not doubting but he that calls us to them, will ſupport us under our Sufferings, <hi>not let us be tempted above what he will make us able to bear,</hi> and Reward us abundantly for them in his Heavenly Kingdom: And how can we Murmur or Repine to bear that Croſs, that will procure an Immortal Crown, or think that a ſad and cruel Death, that will be our Conduct to a Bleſſed and Eternal Life?</p>
               <p>Beſides, this may be a means to reſtore our Nation to its ancient Piety, to recover it out of that deplorable Prophaneſs and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:44080:98"/> into which it is lapſed; for the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſy of the laſt Age hath produced open A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſm and Irreligion in this, and the merciful God having try'd to reclaim us by other means, and thoſe very Sharp and Calamitous, as War, and Plague, and Fire, which effecting no cure or amendment upon the major part of the Nation, it may be his pleaſure (before he ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly forſake or caſt us off) to ſee what the patience and ſufferings of Martyrs will do to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our Reformation; for this was the great inſtrument of converting the World from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſm to Chriſtianity, and therefore may be very effectual to reduce Chriſtians by Profeſſion, from Heathen to Chriſtian Practiſe, to ingage them to live up to the excellent rules of their Religion; for when lewd and vicious Perſons ſee wiſe and good Men chuſe rather to dye, than to do wicked and unlawful things, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer their happineſs in the other, before all their enioyments, in this World, chearefully leave all that is dear to them upon Earth, in hopes to reign with their Lord and Saviour in Heaven, though they do at firſt like thoſe fools the wiſe Man ſpeaks of, <hi>account their life Madneſs, and their end to be without Honour,</hi> yet when they come to conſider better of it, they will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude there is great danger in Sin, becauſe ſuch wiſe perſons would not commit it, to ſave ſo precious Jewels as their lives, but choſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to dye innocent, than to live prophane and wicked, be convinced there are great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards provided for the Righteous after this Life, becauſe Men ſo intelligent would not but upon good grounds, and the moſt rational evidence
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:44080:98"/> be perſwaded to do ſo great, and ſuffer ſo dreadful things in hope of obtaining them: And when they ſee with what admirable courage, invincible patience, undaunted reſolution, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive with what tranſports of joy they go to their Death, kiſſing the ſtake, and courting the flames prepared to conſume their Bodies, becauſe they look for a bleſſed Reſurrection, and believe their ſouls will aſcend by them, like <hi>Elijah</hi> in his fiery Chariot, to the Manſions of Glory, This produces in them an high eſteem and admiration of true Piety and Holineſs, becauſe they effect ſuch admirable things, and from admireing them in theſe, they proceed to love and practiſe them themſelves, <hi>that being holy in all manner of converſation, as he that hath called them is holy,</hi> they may be fit to Suffer for, and to Reign with him in Heavenly bliſs and happineſs. So that the ſufferings of the juſt are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments to convert the Wicked: and from the Piety they practiſed in their Life; and the patience they ſhew'd at their Death, they learn to lead a good and Chriſtian Life, the caſting them into the Fire (though contrary to the mind or intention of the barbarous Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,) is a means to inlighten others, and they that came to ſee the bleſſed Martyr Dye, go away confirmd or ſetled in the Faith, nay re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to dye for it. Thus the Blood of the Martyrs is the Seed of the Church, bringing forth by the bleſſing of God a plentiful Harveſt of new Converts; and therefore, as it is a moſt wicked, ſo it is a moſt imprudent attempt to endeavour to deſtroy the true Religion, by Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:44080:99"/> and putting the moſt eminent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of it to Death, becauſe their Sufferings invite and allure others to it, and drive none but Hypocrites, and weak or fooliſh People from it.</p>
               <p>'Tis your Wiſdom then as well as duty to ſuffer Innocently, rather than to decline it ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, to bear the Croſs your ſelves, rather than lay it ſo unjuſtly upon his Royal Highneſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe our Lord pronounceth that bleſſed, and promiſeth a great Reward to them that do it, but this hath a curſe denounc'd againſt it, will bring the moſt fearful puniſhment upon them that are guilty of it; by that you will ſhew your ſelves Chriſtians, this will prove you Perſecutors; for they that oppreſs and wrong others, upon what colour or pretence ſoever they do it, are any thing rather than Chriſtians, &amp; inſtead of being number'd amongſt the Righteous, ſhall have their Portion amongſt the Cruel and Unjuſt, be the objects of his wrath &amp; diſpleaſure, <hi>Who ordaineth his Arrows againſt the Perſecutors.</hi>

<pb n="171" facs="tcp:44080:102"/> Charges or Expences high; Souldiers cannot Live without their Pay, and are apt both to Plunder and Mutiny if they have it not, and how ſhould the People get Money to pay them, when Trade, that is the only Means to bring it in, is ſtop'd and decay'd. We cannot forget what an Intolerable Burthen and Oppreſſion to the Nation the Rebel Army was in the late times; for many Families were ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly Begger'd and Ruin'd by it, and others ſo Sunk and Cruſh'd in their Eſtates, that they have hardly yet Repaired the Loſſes they then Suſtained: That Army like the Catterpillers and Locuſts of <hi>Egypt</hi> Devour'd every Green thing, greatly Conſumed or Exhauſted the Wealth of the Nation, and when it pleaſed God of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Goodneſs to Reſtore his Majeſty, what vaſt Sums, and a mighty Treaſure, were expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to purchaſe our Deliverance from thoſe Harpies? But this <hi>Bill</hi> of yours would have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd us to our former Slavery and Miſery, it would have been a great and certain Charge, but no ſure Defence or Security to the Nation; For by what Arts or Means could Papiſts be prevented or kept, not only from having Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, but from Liſting themſelves in this new Army? 'Tis true indeed, the Known and Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Papiſts might eaſily be rejected or ſhut out, but are there no Secret Papiſts, none that Entertain the Romiſh Faith in their Hearts, though they do not Confeſs it to any but their own Party with their Mouths? How then ſhall ſuch Recuſants as theſe be Convicted or Found out? Will you tender them the Oaths of Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:44080:103"/> and Supremacy, require them to recieve the Bleſſed Sacrament according to the Cuſtom of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and to be preſent at the Publick Prayers? For all theſe things, you believe, they may have Diſpenſations from the Pope! And being many of them what they are neither known nor ſuſpected to be, Wolves in Sheeps Clothing, Papiſts in Heart, Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants in outward Appearance and Profeſſion, they muſt needs be the more Dangerous, and have the greater Opportunity to do miſchief, and ſo we ſhall give Men wages to Deſtroy us, Arm our Enemies inſtead of our Friends, who inſtead of uſing them in Defence of the King, will Imploy them againſt him.</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſe none of all this to happen, but all this new Army, when they are Liſted, be true to the King, and the Eſtabliſh'd Religion, yet what Aſſurance can there be they will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſo? Did never any Deſert their Religion, nor Depart from their Allegiance in hopes of Gain and Advancement? Are Souldiers gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally Men of that Conſcience and Integrity, as to Refuſe a Bribe? To draw their Swords and Kill the Wicked Men, that Tempt their Faith with Golden Offers, and Tender them ready Money, if they will promiſe their Aſſiſtance, when it is requir'd? If they be, all Hiſtories be-ly, and he did them great Injury, that ſaid, <hi>There is no Truth nor Honeſty in them that follow the Campe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if his Royal Highneſs ſhould Survive the King, would this <hi>Bill of yours,</hi> if it were paſs'd into a Law, Scare him from Demanding and
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:44080:103"/> Endeavouring to Obtain the Crown, or Deter the Army (if they had any Inclination to it) from affording him their Aſſiſtance to gain that Right, which was ſo Unjuſtly and Wrongfully taken from him? Would he not have a great part of <hi>Europe</hi> to joyn with him? If he be what you ſuppoſe him, <hi>Italy,</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> would lend him their Valiant and Numerous Legions to Fight for him, beſides all the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholicks, nay, all the Loyal Proteſtants in the Three Kingdoms would Venture their Lives to Seat him on the Royal Throne, which his Renowned Anceſtors fill'd before him. So that when it came to the Tryal, this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired <hi>Expedient</hi> of yours would not Anſwer your Expectations, inſtead of a two Edged Sword to cut off Popery, it would prove a Wooden Dagger that could do no Feats at all: the Duke hath more Courage and Reſolution than to be Scared with ſuch a Bug as that, and however you may flatter your ſelves, you would be too Weak to make Head againſt the mighty Forces with which he would Attaque you, the paſſing your <hi>Bill</hi> would in the higheſt degree provoke and exaſperate him, but do neither You, nor the Nation any Service at all.</p>
               <p>Now that which would be ſo Dangerous to the King, ſo Chargeable to the People, put them to vaſt Expence, and all to no purpoſe, cannot be for the the good of the Nation; and therefore your Project of <hi>Excluſion</hi> would be a doing <hi>Evil, not that Good</hi> (as you ſuppoſe) <hi>but that Evil, Miſchief, and Ruin may come,</hi> and
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:44080:104"/> ſo you Tranſgreſs or Sin for no Benefit or Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, but as moſt Offendors do, to your Ruin here, and Deſtruction hereafter.</p>
               <p>It deſerves alſo to be conſider'd, whether this <hi>Device</hi> would not be ſo highly Pernicious and Miſchievous as to change the Monarchy, from being <hi>Succeſſive,</hi> to be <hi>Elective,</hi> that is, from the beſt to the worſt ſort of Monarchy? I cannot ſee but it would; for to paſs this <hi>Bill</hi> into a Law, is in effect to give the Houſe of Commons the Donation or Diſpoſal of the Crown; for if they Diſinherit One, why may they not Deprive a Second, and a Third of the Royal Family, and make as many <hi>Bills of Excluſion</hi> as they Pleaſe? for whenever they take Offence, or entertain Prejudice againſt the next Heir, 'tis but prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch a <hi>Bill</hi> againſt him, branding him with the hateful Name of Papiſt, Voting him an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy to the Nation, Loading him with Black and Odious Accuſations, whether true or falſe it matters not, ſo they do but ſeem to believe them themſelves, and can but perſwade the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to believe them, which is an eaſie thing to do, becauſe they are Naturally Suſpitious, very Prone to entertain Ill Opinions of thoſe that do, or are to Govern or Rule over them, and having gain'd the Multitude, 'tis but Watching Opportunities, taking Advantage of the Kings Neceſſities, when his great Affairs require ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, to give him none, till he paſs the <hi>Exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Bill.</hi> In this Caſe what can the King do? If he Diſſolves them, and calls another, the People will Elect them again, and Encouraged by their adhereing to them, they will be more
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:44080:104"/> Reſolute, and Importunate, till they gain their point, and by their immoveable Obſtinacy tire out the Royal Patience, and ſo force it to yeild, which they may do as often as they pleaſe, and the doing of it will both entail War and Miſery upon the Nation, unleſs we will be ſo unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, as to ſuppoſe that the <hi>Excluded</hi> Princes will be ſo Cowardly and Poor Spirited, as to ſit down Patiently under ſo great an Injury, and not At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to recover by Arms that Right, which was ſo Unjuſtly taken from them; and alſo make the Monarchy Elective, which is upon Divers Accounts the worſt ſort of Monarchy.</p>
               <p>Firſt, as it Tempts the Prince Reigning to uſe all kind of Arts and Means to Enrich him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and fill his Royal Treaſury; for being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain whether any of his Children and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendents ſhall be Elected in his place, when he retires into the ſhades of Death, that Natural Affection for, and Care of his Royal Iſſue, which is Common to Kings as well as other Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, will ſtrongly incline and prompt him to Watch all Opportunities, to caſt about and contrive all ways to amaſs all the Wealth and Treaſure he can, that if he be deſirous his Son ſhould ſucceed him, he may leave him Money enough to bribe the Electors, or if he do not deſign that, yet that he may provide for all his Children ſo, that they may Live in that State, Honour, and Magnifience, which become the Off-ſpring of a King, and will caſt no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt nor Reproach upon him, when he is Dead and gone.</p>
               <pb n="176" facs="tcp:44080:105"/>
               <p>This will produce frequent Oppreſſions of the People, and the moſt grievous Rapines and Exactions, expoſe all Places and Offices, Sacred, Civil, and Military, to Sale; ſo that they who have nothing but Money to Recommend them, ſhall be prefer'd, and Honeſt and Deſerving Men, that have either leſs Money or more Conſcience than to give Bribes, will be Reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or put by, to the great injury or damage of the State: And they that pay dear for their Places will be ſure to make the moſt they can of them, both becauſe they coſt them ſo, and they are uncertain how long they ſhall hold them, Princes being Mortal as well as other Men, and when they Dye, moſt, if not all the Preferments and great Places they enjoy under, Dye with them.</p>
               <p>The publick Treaſure alſo, inſtead of being Imploy'd for the Common good, will be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to the Princes private uſe: when other Nations do Injury and Violence to his Subjects, and he ſeems to be Offended at it, and it may be really is ſo, and Aggravates the wrong to draw Money from the People, under pretence of Revenging of it, yet having got it into his hands, he only talks high, threatens them that did the Injury, expoſtulates the Caſe, upbraids them with their Unjuſt Dealing, or it may be demands Reparation, whereupon if they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg their Errour, and promiſe to be Juſt for the future, he puts up the Injury, though never ſo Grievous or Ruinous to his own Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and fills his Coffers with the Treaſure, that was given him to do them Right. To ſuch
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:44080:105"/> mean and unbecoming ſhifts are Elective Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs tempted, which muſt needs inrage their People, and put them upon frequent Tumults and Inſurrections, for being impoveriſh'd and exhauſted by continual Rapines, and Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions they grow Deſperate, Reſolve to Venture their Lives, nay, which are infinitely more precious, their Souls (Rebellion being a moſt horrid and damnable Sin) to revenge the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries done them by their Prince, who inſtead of a Father is ſo unjuſt and injurious to them: By which means both the Prince and People Suffer, They in their Eſtates and Properties, He in his Honour, Safety, and Tranquillity. And that muſt needs be a miſerable and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper'd State, where neither Prince nor Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are ſafe and happy, but he makes a Prey of them, and they watch their opportunity to Depoſe and Ruin him.</p>
               <p>But theſe miſchiefs, and miſeries are not ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to Succeſſive Monarchies, rightly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted, as our is, for when the Prince knows, and is aſſured, that the Crown ſhall deſcend to his Royal Off-ſpring, (if he have any,) or to the next of his Family, he hath no temptation to oppreſs his People, no neceſſity to uſe any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Arts to inrich himſelf, to fill his Coffers with the Treaſures of unrighteouſneſs: He pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers the publick good before his private gain, his Subjects are ſecured in their Rights and Properties, protected from the Injuries and Violence of Forreigners, and from Rapines and Oppreſſions at home. The Prince is care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful by a juſt and merciful Government to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:44080:106"/> his own, and the Honour of his Family, that the admirable Vertues of his Illuſtrious Predeceſſors may raiſe the Expectation, and indear the Affection of the People to the next Heir, take from them all doubt or fear but he will prove a brave Prince, becauſe Deſcended from the beſt of Kings, who did not only (as far as Mortals can do it) reſemble God in Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er &amp; Greatneſs, but in Juſtice, Mercy, Clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy &amp; Goodneſs, nothing being ſo great an Incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, ſo mighty a provocation, ſo prevailing an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement to ingage a young Prince to be Juſt &amp; Vertuous, as that his Anceſtors were ſo before him, &amp; he will bluſh to Inherit their greatneſs, if he be not Studious to tranſcribe &amp; imitate their Royal Goodneſs. This hath been remarkably verifi'd or fulfill'd in our preſent moſt Gracious Soveraign, &amp; the three fore-going Princes, who did not only tranſmit the Crown, but their incomparable Vertues to one another. As for that Renowned Princeſs, Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> her Royal Vertues have imbalmed her Memory, render'd it ſweet and precious to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, and ſhe will be remember'd with Honour by late and ſtill diſtant Ages: Some few things indeed ſeem a little to cloud the Glory of her Reign, but they are nothing in reſpect of the Great, Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, and Eminent Bleſſings the Nation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd under her wiſe, and wary Government; thoſe poſſibly were extorted from her by the difficulty of the Times, and the neceſſity of her Affairs, and the miſguided Zeal of ſome of her Favourites and Counſellors, but theſe made abundant recompence, or reparation for them,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:44080:106"/> render'd her revered and admir'd all over the Chriſtian World, inſomuch that one of her E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies Confeſs'd her to be the Braveſt, moſt Glorious, and Fortunate Princeſs in the World.</p>
               <p>Deſcend from her to King <hi>James,</hi> who Succeeded her, as in her Royal Dignity, ſo in all her Vertues, a Prince of admirable Wiſdom, Juſtice, and Clemency, ſo great a Lover, ſo watchful a Preſerver of Peace, that in his Reign the Nation grew vaſtly Rich, and abounded ſo in Treaſure, as if the precious Mines had been removed from the <hi>Indies</hi> hither. What ſhall I ſay of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt? No Eloquence can deſcribe all his Encellencies, no Commendations reach his tranſcendent Vertues, they are fitter for our ſilent Admiration, than our imperfect and unequal Praiſes; never any Mortal approach'd nearer to Him, who was more than Man, even God manifeſt in the Fleſh, whilſt he Lived he was a Saint upon Earth, and dying was num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber'd amongſt the prime Saints in Heaven, His Enemies were ſuch as are always Enemies to God and all goodneſs, (that is) the Devil and his Agents, and they that depoſed, and took away his precious Life, would have done the ſame execrable Violence and Injury to the Son of God himſelf, if he had fallen into their Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous and Bloody Hands. And our preſent moſt Gracious Soveraign is equal to any of his Renowned Anceſtors in the Princely Vertues of Wiſdom, Fortitude, Juſtice, Mercy, Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, and the admirable ſweetneſs and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Temper. So that I may Challenge all the World to ſhew me four ſuch Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:44080:107"/> one after another, in any Elective Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, ſo Zealous Defenders of the true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo Tender of their Subjects Welfare, ſuch Bountiful Patrons and Benefactors to them, that they did what they could to preſerve them in Peace, Piety, and Plenty, And if in any of their Reigns, any of the People Suffer'd, and were Miſerable, it was not the Princes Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice that made them ſo, but either their own, or their fellow Subjects Stubbornneſs, Diſobedience, and Turbulent or Ungovernable Temper, that brought Calamity and Ruin upon them. And ſeeing Elective Princes have more, and greater Temptations to Oppreſs and Injure their Subjects than thoſe that are Succeſſive, the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lective muſt needs be the worſt ſort of Monarchy.</p>
               <p>And it is ſo, Secondly, becauſe expoſed to manifold Factions, Diſcontents, Quarrels, and Dangers: We ſee to what Heats, Factions, and Diſorders, far inferiour Elections are ſubject, that they who are to chuſe a Parliament Man for a County, or a Burgeſs for a Corporation, cannot all Agtee or Fix upon a Perſon, but Run into Parties and Factions, one ſide being fierce and eager for one Man, and the other for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, till they grow angry and inraged, hate and revile one another, proceed from words to blows, and would break out into open Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtility, were there not a Superiour Authority, to which they are accountable for ſuch diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and therefore ſtand in awe of. How much more apt to Feuds and Quarrels, to Factions and Diſcontents may they be reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably ſuppoſed to be, that have the Diſpoſal
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:44080:107"/> of ſuch a Jewel as a Crown, and whoſe Votes are of that moment and concern, as to confer ſo precious, and by all, admired a Treaſure, as a Kingdom, and have none to awe or pacifie them, the Electors (during the <hi>Interregnum</hi>) being the chief and moſt courted Perſons of the Kingdom, and may (unleſs limited by Law) Protract or Spin out the Election as long as they pleaſe, and accordingly as they are Byaſſed by Affection, or Intereſt, which may be of Dangerous Conſequence to the Kingdom; For if any Neighbouring Prince prompted ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by his Ambition, or provoked by Injuries formerly receiv'd, take that Opportunity to Invade them, whilſt they are debating and quarrelling amongſt themſelves who ſhall be King, they are in all probability ſurpris'd and ruin'd, for either they muſt agree and finiſh the Election preſently, (which the Prince that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vades may eaſily prevent by bribing ſome of the Electors) or elſe they muſt imploy ſome great Perſon to defend the Kingdom, till they have done it: He, if he ſucceeds in his Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and beats the Invader out, if he be not Elected King, calls them Ungrateful, thinks himſelf affronted, his good Service ſlighted or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned, &amp; having the Army under his Command may eaſily work upon them by gifts at preſent, and promiſes of doing great things for them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, to afford him their Aſſiſtance to make him King, by which means the Kingdom is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broyl'd, ſtain'd with the Blood, made miſerable by the Slaughter and Deſtruction of the Inhabitants, by the Ruin of Cities, and Vaſtation or Spoyl of Provinces. But if on the other ſide the Electors
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:44080:108"/> chuſe him King, then the other Grandees are diſcontented, and think they have the greateſt injury done them, every one of them in his own Opinion eſteeming himſelf, at leaſt as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving or worthy of a Crown, as the Prince E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, and therefore to revenge the contempt put upon them, either break out into Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, or invite the Invader to return, with of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer of their aſſiſtance to poſſeſs him of the Kingdom: So that between Forreign Force, and Domeſtick Ambition, and Diſcontent, the poor People endure all the Calamities of War, and linger out a tedious Life, made ſo by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Oppreſſions, Terrours, and Diſcontents.</p>
               <p>And as the People are miſerable in Elective Monarchies, ſo the Prince is unſafe, for there is nothing that great Spirits are more Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious of than a Crown, and the Cardinals can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſibly be more weary of a long Lived Pope, than moſt of the Grandees in an Elective Kingdom hate a long lived Prince; the reaſon is plain, becauſe the Crown not being peculiar or appropriate to any one Family, the more frequent Vacancies there are, the greater hopes they have of being Elected, which is a mighty Temptation to Ambitious and Deſigning Men; to uſe all the Villanous and Accurſed Arts they can, by Poyſon, and other ſecret ways, to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy, or Take off the Prince, that they may fill his Throne, whom they have by the baſeſt and moſt perfidious cruelty deprived of his Life and Kingdom. The laſt King of <hi>Poland</hi> lay under great Fears, and Apprehenſions, that he ſhould be Poyſon'd, and his Suſpitions of it
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:44080:108"/> were ſo ſtrong and vehement, that all the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments his Friends could uſe, could not put them out of his Thoughts; what reaſon he had for thoſe fears, I know not, nor can I tell whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his Death was procured by ſuch deteſtable means, or no; but ſure I am, that many think ſuch execrable things lawful, <hi>Regnandi cauſa,</hi> to poſſeſs themſelves of Empire and Soveraignty, and there is the greateſt temptation to practice them in Elective Monarchies, becauſe upon the deceaſe of the Prince Reigning, every great Perſon in the Kingdom flatters himſelf, with hopes of Succeeding him.</p>
               <p>But the Succeſſive Monarchies are freer from all theſe Evils and Dangers, for upon the Death of the Royal Father, his Son, if he have any, or elſe the next of the Family, is King, which makes our Law ſay, the King never Dies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe upon the Deceaſe of one, the next Heir is immediately King, the Ceremonies of Crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Anoynting do not confer the Royal Dignity upon him, but only declare him to be what he was as ſoon as his Predeceſſor was dead, that is, King, are no more but ſigns expreſſing to the People, that he is the perſon ordain'd by God to Govern, or Rule over them, and to whom he requires them to pay all due Honour, Loyalty, and Obedience. By this immediate Succeſſion all thoſe Factions are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided, which often prove miſchievous and Ruinous to the People, &amp; ſo are all the Dangers &amp; Miſeries which attend an <hi>Interregnum,</hi> that may happen in the interval between the Death of one, and the Election of another Prince; no Forreign Enemy can have any encouragement
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:44080:109"/> to invade the Kingdom upon the Death of the King, becauſe the Royal Throne is fill'd by the next Heir, who ſucceeds immediately, and the People have a new Prince ready to protect and defend them (as the other did) from the Violence and Injuries of all their Enemies.</p>
               <p>Nor are the People only happier, but the Prince alſo is ſafer than in the other ſort of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, for the Crown when he dies deſcending to his Heirs, what temptation can any, that is not of the Royal Family, have to attempt any thing either againſt his Life or Government? If his Treaſon againſt the King himſelf ſhould ſucceed, (as by the juſt Judgment of God ſuch Villany ſeldom doth) unleſs he could deſtroy all the Royal Family, what is he the better? Will not they revenge the Parricide in this, and the righteous God Puniſh the Actor of it with the moſt horrible damnation in the other World? So that unleſs the Princes Enemies be thoſe of his own Houſe, and they that have a Title to the Crown, when he is Dead, conſpire againſt, and make him away, which is more horrid, unnatural, and villanous than it can poſſibly be in any other Traytors, and that which, by the juſt Judgment of God, will bring the ſame barbarous and bloody fate upon themſelves, for how can any Prince ſit ſafe or eaſie upon that Throne, which he ſtain'd with the Blood of his Father, or Brother, or Kinſman? Will not the guilt and horrour of his Fact terrifie and diſtract, make him affraid with <hi>Cain,</hi> that every Man that ſees will ſlay him? How is it poſſible he ſhould enjoy an happy day, or a
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:44080:109"/> quiet hour, that is haunted with an Evil Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, groans under the ſmart and anguiſh of it, and hath the guilt of Royal and Innocent Blood lying as an intolerable load and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then upon his Soul? So that, excepting theſe, no other Traytors can have any Inducement or Encouragement to attempt the Princes Life, becauſe they can propoſe to themſelves no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable benefit, or advantage by it; for if their Treaſon proſper, and one of them ſeize, or poſſeſs himſelf of the Kingdom, he comes in as a Thief, and Murderer, and Uſurper, and as ſuch is abhorr'd by all the Honeſt and Loyal part of the Kingdom, who, to revenge the injury done to their Lawful Prince, will aſſiſt the next Heir againſt the Uſurper, and his own party, by whoſe help he Kill'd, and took poſſeſſion, prompted either by Envy at his Greatneſs, or by Diſcontent, as not thinking themſelves ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently rewarded for the ſervice they did him, will in a little time grow weary of, and lend their helping hands to deſtroy him. And being moſt obnoxious to Factions, Wars, and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, the <hi>Elective</hi> muſt needs be the worſt ſort of Monarchy.</p>
               <p>Now that which is Evil or Sinful in it ſelf, and being done, cannot be defended without a ſtanding Army, (if that can do it) which would impoveriſh and Ruin the Kingdom, and tends likewiſe to Subvert or change the Monarchy, is to ſin or do evil for evils ſake, which is the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt wickedneſs, and if their Damnation be juſt, as the Apoſtle ſays it is, that do evil, that good may come, theirs muſt needs be more juſt and
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:44080:110"/> fearful, who do evil, that miſchief, miſery, and ruin may come both upon Prince and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
               <p>But though this Device be contrary to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, yet it is, they plead, agreeable to Natural <note place="margin">Subject 4.</note> Juſtice, though the Law of Chriſt condemns, yet the Law of Nature (they ſay) allows and warrants it. This is a weak or idle pretence, for is not Chriſtianity a perfect Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt or Body of the Law of Nature? doth it not contain all the practical dictates of Right Reaſon? That it is, and doth, may be proved from the great end of, and the things contained in both theſe Laws: from the great end of them, for is it the prime or chief deſign of the Law of Nature to promote the common good of all Rational Beings, that is, the <hi>Glory of God,</hi> and the <hi>Felicity of Mankind?</hi> This is equally the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of the <hi>Law of Chriſt,</hi> which takes care, that God have his <hi>Honour,</hi> and that Men live <hi>happily:</hi> That God have his Honour, the Honour of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration, Love, and Imitation: The firſt, as it requires and directs, tells mankind they muſt Adore, or Worſhip the Glorious Author of their Being, and ſhews them how to do it acceptably, enjoyns the one with the higheſt Sanctions, Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers of the greateſt rewards, if they pay unto God the Glory and Worſhip due unto him, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciations of the moſt dreadful puniſhments, if they neglect or refuſe to do it: Deſcribes the other (the right way of doing it) ſo plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and intelligibly, that they cannot Err or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake in it, without their own fault, thoſe words
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:44080:110"/> of Chriſt being a full and plain, both Precept, and Direction, for conducting this great Duty, <hi>God is a Spirit, and they that Worſhip him muſt</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">St. John 4. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>Worſhip him in Spirit and in Truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The honour of Love, by repreſenting to us the tranſcendent Excellencies and Perfections of his Nature, his admirable Bounty and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficence to us, and the perfect Equity or Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs of all his Precepts, that the firſt may produce in us a due eſteem and admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him, the ſecond ingage us to the choice of him, prompt us to the purſuit of him as our happineſs, and oblige us to make him all the grateful returns we are able; the third excite and endear our Obedience to him.</p>
               <p>The honour of imitation, that we tranſcribe his excellencies and perfections as far as we can, be <hi>mercifully as our heavenly father is merciful, and holy as he is holy,</hi> expreſs in our actions, ſuch a conformity to his Purity, Juſtice, Benignity, and univerſal kindneſs to his Creatures, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Rational, <hi>that Men may See our good works, and Glorifie our Father which is in Heaven;</hi> becauſe this ſhews the mighty value and eſteem we have for him, is an open Declaration, that we think him the moſt excellent Being, whom it is our honour as well as duty to reſemble, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is the higheſt Glorification of him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> too promotes the <hi>Felicity of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,</hi> and that ſo fully or perfectly, that if they would intirely comply with it, they could not poſſibly be miſerable. Their Happineſs ſingle or a part, and as conjoyn'd or united in Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: Every Man that obeys or lives up to the
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:44080:111"/> Law of Chriſt, is therefore happy, becauſe he enjoys the ſweeteſt peace and tranquillity of mind, his appetites and paſſions are ſo reſtrain'd, and ſubdued, as to create him no trouble nor vexation, they do not lead him into any of thoſe evil practices, which being done, diſturb, and wound the Soul, produce in it amazing fears and expectations of puniſhment, the vertues and good works he performs are ſweet, and grateful to him, <hi>all their ways are ways of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſs, and all their paths are peace,</hi> afford his Soul its deſired reſt and ſatisfaction, he is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aſhamed in publick, nor affraid in private, but finds his actions ſo fair, and juſt, and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the dictates of right reaſon, that he is highly pleaſed every time he reflects upon them.</p>
               <p>And as his obedience to the Law of Chriſt ſecures his inward, ſo it provides for his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward happineſs; for every Man, that Lives as Chriſt requires him, hath his promiſe to aſſure him of all thoſe Enjoyments, that are neceſſary to his well being upon Earth; his Piety to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the great Governour of the World, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites his Bounty, and calls down his Bleſſings upon him, and he that is ſo liberal to all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Creatures, as to open his hand, and fill them with plenteouſneſs, will not let thoſe No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler Beings, that Love, Adore, and Reverence him, want any thing that is good for them.</p>
               <p>Beſides, the ſeveral branches of the Law of Chriſt, the Vertues it commands us to practice, have a direct tendency this way: thus Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance preſerves our Health and Eſtates, makes
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:44080:111"/> our Lives both long, and provided for, and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice is not only an Honour or Reputation, but a great Safeguard and Advantage to us; the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour or Diligence Chriſtianity enjoyns every Man to imploy in his calling, hath an apparent tendency, both to obtain theſe outward conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies of Life, and to improve or increaſe them, and the being Contented with the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions that either deſcended to him by Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, or which he acquired by the Bleſſing of God upon his labour and induſtry, affords him great Comfort and Delight, as it frees him from the vexations of Covetouſneſs, the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſneſs of Expectation, and Attendance, the grief and torment of Diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and obliges him to an acquieſcence and ſatisfaction in his preſent Enjoyments; he that is continually deſiring and purſuing things which he apprehends to be neceſſary ingredients in his happineſs, or the materials of which it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, muſt needs be miſerable, becauſe he hath not attained to, but is in purſuit of that which he calls his happineſs, and is uncertain whether he ſhall ever be able to poſſeſs himſelf of it, but the contented Perſon is actually hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, becauſe he hath reduced his deſires to a complacency or delight in that which he is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd of. And as theſe, ſo all the other parts of the <hi>Chriſtian Law,</hi> are a preſent Bleſſing and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to the Obſervers of them, as well as the Conditions of that Eternal Felicity which is to commence at the period of this life, there being ſuch a neceſſary connexion between the Precepts of Chriſt, and the Rewards of his
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:44080:112"/> Kingdom, that they who obey the one; ſhall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly enjoy the other, and they muſt needs be Bleſſed to eternal Ages, that perform thoſe noble things, to which our Lord hath promiſed that bleſſedneſs, both becauſe he is faithful that hath promis'd, and that is the certain conſequence or reſult of thoſe.</p>
               <p>So that conſider'd ſingle or a part, Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity makes every Man happy that obeys, or lives according to it. It promotes the felicity of mankind alſo, as conjoyn'd or united in So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties, which are either private or publick, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies or Kingdoms.</p>
               <p>The happineſs of Families, by obliging Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands to love, &amp; treat their Wives with due ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, and reſpect, and them to reverence, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey, and be faithful to their Husbands, and to live together in peace and concord; by injoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Parents (as nature prompts them) to take care of their Off-Spring, to Provide for, and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducate them in Piety and the Fear of God, and theſe to Honour, Obey, and (if by any of the misfortunes of the World they fall into want, as gratitude obliges them) to relieve their Parents; by requiring Servants to be faithful and obedient to their Maſters, and theſe to be juſt, merciful, &amp; compaſſionate to them, knowing they have a Maſter in Heaven, God Almighty, to whom they are anſwerable for all their Actions; for in the performance of theſe mutual Offices, the felicity or welfare of Families conſiſts.</p>
               <p>The happineſs of Kingdoms, by obliging Princes to Govern with Mercy and Juſtice, to
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:44080:112"/> take care, that their People <hi>lead quiet and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able lives in all godlineſs and honeſty,</hi> that they neither wrong one another, nor be injured by other Princes or States, but that they be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected both in their Perſons, and Eſtates, from Violence and Oppreſſion; by requiring the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to honour and obey their Princes, and all that are in Authority under them, to pray for their proſperity, to pay them Tribute, to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them with their Perſons, and Eſtates, that no harm nor violence may happen to them; by Commanding all the People to Love, and deal Juſtly one with another, not to hurt or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure, but to Help and Succour, or as they have Oppertunity <hi>to do good unto all Men, to put on Bowels of Mercies, Kindneſs, Humbleneſs of Mind, Meekneſs, long ſuffering, forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any Man have a quarrel againſt any,</hi> which are excellent Preſervatives of that Peace and Unity, which they are Commanded to follow with all Men, and without which they cannot be happy.</p>
               <p>And is not that an happy Kingdom, where the Prince Governs with Juſtice and Mercy, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves his People in Piety, Peace, and Safety, they Honour, Obey, and Serve him faithfully, deal Juſtly with, and Love one another, where there are no Cruelties nor Oppreſſions, no Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons nor Seditions, no Hatred nor Contentions, but Juſtice, Loyalty, Peace and Charity Reign or Flouriſh? this muſt needs be an happy King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and the People Bleſſed that are in ſuch a Caſe, and if Chriſtianity was heartily and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally received and obey'd, it would make all
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:44080:113"/> the Kingdoms and Nations of the World ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding happy and bleſſed, not only conduct Men to Heaven when they Dye, but turn this Earth into a kind of Heaven to them whilſt they Live.</p>
               <p>And ſeeing Chriſtianity proſecutes that which is the great deſign or tendency of the Law of Nature, the Common good of all Rational Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, the Glory of God, and the Felicity of Mankind, 'tis reaſonable to believe, that this is contained in that, That the Law of Chriſt is a perfect Digeſt or Body of the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. This might be farther confirm'd by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring things contained in both theſe great Laws, but this I need not do, becauſe every Mans Reaſon will tell him, that theſe Laws, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the ſame Author, and the ſame end, muſt be the ſame in Subſtance, and agree in the Means miniſtring to that, which is equally the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of both, for neither can God be Glorifi'd, nor Mankind made happy, any other way than that which Chriſtianity directs, and the Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Author of it reduces to theſe two Heads, <hi>the Love of God, and our Neighbour,</hi> the firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining all thoſe Expreſſions of Honour, which the Tranſcendent Excellencies and Perfections of the Divine Nature challenge from us, and all thoſe grateful Returns, which as obliged Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, we owe to our great Benefactor, the other comprehending all that Juſtice, Mercy, Charity, Temperance, and thoſe other Vertues which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to our own, and the Common Felicity of Mankind, and are ſo abſolutely neceſſary in order to it, that it cannot be attain'd without them.</p>
               <pb n="193" facs="tcp:44080:113"/>
               <p>The Abſurdities too, that are conſequent to the denying of it, argue that the Law of Chriſt contains all thoſe Moral Duties, to which Men are obliged by the Law of Nature, for if it doth not, then either the Law of Nature is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſh'd, or elſe God hath two contrary Laws in force at the ſame time: It cannot be abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd, becauſe it is of Eternal Obligation, Men being for ever bound to the practice of Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety towards God, and of Juſtice to one another, becauſe both theſe promote his Glory, and their Felicity. But if the Law of Nature be ſtill in force, and doth not oblige us to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of that Piety and Juſtice, which the Law of Chriſt ſo ſtrictly and expreſly requires of us, then God hath two contrary Laws Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory at the ſame time, A Law that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us to Honour Him, and to deal Juſtly with all Men; and, A Law that Allows us to Diſhonour him, and to be Unjuſt to them: For is not the Law of Nature a Law which God hath impreſs'd upon our Minds? And hath not the Law of Chriſt the ſame Bleſſed Author? And are they not both bound upon us by the ſame Rewards and Puniſhments, Peace and Satisfaction of Mind now, if we obey, Guilt and Horrour of Conſcience at preſent, if we Violate or Tranſgreſs them, and by the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of theſe, Eternal Felicity, or Miſery after this Life? The Law of Nature and the Law of Chriſt, have the ſame Divine Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, God did by Chriſt inſtruct Mankind in all Ages of the World, <hi>He</hi> (ſaith a Reverend
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:44080:114"/> Perſon) <hi>Taught the Law of Nature to all men,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ductor Dubitan. pa. 180.</note> 
                  <hi>and renewed it, and made a perfect Body of it, to laſt as long as our Nature laſts, and as long as this World, and his Kingdom abides.</hi> And being both of them his Laws, to ſay they do not require the ſame Moral Duties of us, is to ſay he hath two contrary Laws in force at the ſame time, which is to revile and reproach him; for if he requires us to obey two contrary Laws at the ſame time, then he requires us to do that which is impoſſible, and ſo is neither wiſe nor juſt: I conclude therefore, that Chriſtianity is a perfect Digeſt of the Law of Nature, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains all the Moral Precepts of it: And if ſo, then whatever is unjuſt by the Law of Chriſt, muſt needs be equally ſo by the Law of Nature, and no Man may do any thing Contrary to that, becauſe if he doth, he is a Tranſgreſſor of this.</p>
               <p>Beſides, Chriſtianity, 'tis certain, binds Men al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to do that which is juſt (<hi>to do unto others,</hi> that is, <hi>as they would be done unto themſelves,</hi>) and if the Law of Nature doth not oblige them to do ſo too, then God is the Author of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt Law, the Law of Nature being his Law, as well as the Chriſtian, and then how is he Righteous in all his ways?</p>
               <p>And therefore it is moſt unreaſonable to ſay, the <hi>Bill of Excluſion,</hi> (if it be contrary to <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Juſtice,</hi> as I ſuppoſe I have proved it,) is agreeable to <hi>Natural Juſtice,</hi> nothing being Juſt by the <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> that is not ſo by the <hi>Law of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="195" facs="tcp:44080:114"/>
               <p>But the truth is, the <hi>Bill</hi> is as contrary to the <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> as I have proved it to be to the <hi>Law of Chriſt.</hi> 'Tis contrary to the great Deſign of it, hath no tendency to promote the Honour of God, nor the Felicity of Mankind: not the firſt, becauſe God cannot be Honour'd by any thing that he hath forbidden, and is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the Integrity and Perfection of his Nature, but he forbids all Injuſtice and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, is Righteous in all his ways, and Loves Righteouſneſs in others, and it is for ever great and high Injuſtice for Men to do that to another, which they would not have done to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Bill,</hi> if it was paſſed, would contribute nothing to the Felicity of Mankind in General, afford them no Benefit at all, but might in the conſequences of it be Injurious to them all; for if one Man be unjuſtly deprived of his Right, they that have Power may offer the ſame Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to a ſecond and a third, nay to as many as they can, till at laſt Injuſtice and Oppreſſion Reign every where. Beſides, the Sufferings of one Prince expoſe all that are of that moſt High and Sacred Order to the like Danger, and if one Nation or People Diſinherit the next Heir to the Crown, other Nations may take the ſame Meaſures, and offer the ſame Indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Injury to their Princes, which will fill the World with War and Miſery, Blood and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
               <p>It would not be for the happineſs of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (as I have proved already) becauſe it would bring a certain and preſent evil or miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:44080:115"/> upon it, to remove a remote and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent one, is too weak a Remedy to effect the Cure it deſigns, and inſtead of keeping out Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, would bring in War and Confuſion, Deſolation and Miſery, and therefore is againſt Prudence, as well as the great Deſign of the Law of Nature.</p>
               <p>Beſides, that which is contrary to right Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, is Repugnant to the Law of Nature, to Injure or make any Man Miſerable, that hath not attempted to uſe others ſo, is contrary to right Reaſon, to Paſs the <hi>Bill</hi> is to Injure or make the Duke Miſerable (as far as a Law can do it) he hath not attempted any ſuch thing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards others, therefore the <hi>Bill</hi> is Repugnant to the Law of Nature. To ſay he will do it, if he comes to the Crown, is a Raſh, Ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and Uncharitable Aſſertion, becauſe he can have no reaſon to do it, it being not for his Honour, nor his Happineſs, either in this World or the other, to Injure or make them he Governs Miſerable.</p>
               <p>'Tis agreeable to that Juſtice, Candour, and Ingenuity, to which we are obliged as Rational and Sociable Creatures, to think that Perſon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends us no Injury, that neither by his Words nor Actions diſcovers a Malevolent Mind to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, the Duke hath neither of theſe ways diſcover'd ſuch a Mind towards us, therefore we are obliged to think he intends us no Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. If it be ſaid, he holds no Religious Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with us, and that is a ſufficient Indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that he bears a Malevolent Mind towards us, I Anſwer, that at moſt it argues but a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfi'd
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:44080:115"/> Mind, or an Erroneous Perſwaſion of our way of Worſhip, that he hath ſuch an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of, as to ſuſpend Communion with us in it at preſent, but it diſcovers no hatred of, ſhews no intention in him to do us injury, proves him to be a Diſſenter from, not an Hater of us, becauſe Honeſt Men may be of different Perſwaſions in Religion, and yet heartily Love, and therefore neither intend, nor do any Evil to one another. If he thinks us in the Wrong, he may Pity, and Pray God to bring us into the Right way, and if we believe him in Error, we ought to Pity, and Pray for him, not deprive him of his Birth-right; becauſe that is Chriſtian and Pious, this Unjuſt and Barbarous, and ſuch as is offer'd to none of the Diſſenters.</p>
               <p>That which is agreable to Common Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, is agreeable to the Law of Nature, 'tis agreeable to Common Prudence for Men weary of a State of War (in which according to Mr. <hi>Hobs,</hi> their Nature put them) to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Civil Society for their Mutual Safety and Security, therefore it is agreeable to the Law of Nature for Men to enter into Civil So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety.</p>
               <p>That which is Deſtructive of Civil Society, is a Violation of the Law of Nature, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive Men of their Rights and Properties upon meer Jealouſies and Suſpicions, is Deſtructive of Civil Society, the <hi>Bill of Excluſion</hi> would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive his Royal Highneſs of Birth-right, which is founded in the Law of Nature, upon meer Jealouſies and Suſpicions, therefore the <hi>Bill</hi> is a Violation of the Law of Nature.</p>
               <pb n="198" facs="tcp:44080:116"/>
               <p>The Duke hath <hi>de facto</hi> done nothing Viſſible, that is Injurious to the Nation, therefore the Authors of the <hi>Bill</hi> proceed upon meer Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies and Suſpicions, and conſequently do Unjuſtly, becauſe they Injure an Innocent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, for every Man is to be preſumed ſo to be, till the contrary appears by his Actions.</p>
               <p>But ſelf Preſervation (they ſay) is the prime dictate of the Law of Nature, or that which it prompts all Men to; ſuppoſing that, yet Men muſt not imagine themſelves to be in Danger, that they may have a pretence to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs &amp; injure others, Violence muſt be offer'd to, Injury done them, or at leaſt be threatned, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they can reaſonably apprehend themſelves endanger'd, or juſtly defend themſelves, but for <hi>Antonius</hi> only to ſuſpect that the brave <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banius</hi> intends to do him a miſchief, and upon that Suſpicion to do him Injury and Miſchief by way of Anticipation, is moſt unreaſonable, and therefore moſt unjuſt.</p>
               <p>Beſides, every private Man is, and therefore muſt be conſider'd as a Member of ſome Civil Society, &amp; as ſuch he hath no Right in all Caſes to provide for his own Safety, in Oppoſition to the Safety and Preſervation of the whole Society. 'Tis more for a Mans Safety to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his Trade, or till the Earth, than to bear Arms, or go to the Wars, two Armies cannot Fight but ſome of the Combatants will be Slain, and though ſome always Eſcape, yet no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Perſon hath any aſſurance that he ſhall not Dye in the Battel: But notwithſtanding the Appendent Danger, Men are bound to
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:44080:116"/> Fight in defence of their Prince and Country, that is, to prefer the publick before their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate ſafety, that being generous and brave, the contrary baſe and infamous. We ſee in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural body, the hand will expoſe it ſelf to dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger for the ſafety of the head, and therefore ſome of the members of the body politick are obliged to expoſe themſelves to danger for the welfare and ſafety of the whole Society.</p>
               <p>But every Nation or Civil Society, hath a Right to preſerve it ſelf, the <hi>Bill of Excluſion</hi> (they ſay) is for the preſervation of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, therefore it is a purſuance of that Right: The propoſition is true (if rightly underſtood) the aſſumption falſe, for the <hi>Bill</hi> is not for the preſervation of the Nation. The Duke will either ſurvive the King, or not; if he do not, the Nation is ſafe without the <hi>Bill,</hi> and then to paſs it is to do unjuſtly, to no purpoſe, for no benefit at all, nay to our loſs and injury, becauſe if the <hi>Bill</hi> be paſs'd, the injuſtice of it cannot be defended without a ſtanding Army, which would be a vaſt charge, &amp; therefore a mighty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury to the Nation: But if the Duke ſurvive the King, the paſſing the <hi>Bill</hi> can be no preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive or ſecurity to the Nation, becauſe it is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputed by wiſe and learned men, whether ſuch a Law would not be null or void in it ſelf, and becauſe 'tis certain that no Law can deter him from endeavouring to obtain the Crown, and therefore the paſſing the <hi>Bill</hi> (if the Duke ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive the King) will certainly produce a War, and ſo be to the Deſtruction, not the Happineſs or Preſervation of the Nation.</p>
               <pb n="200" facs="tcp:44080:117"/>
               <p>That Peace is to be purſued and and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, is one of the prime Dictates of Right Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and one of the chief Laws of Nature, becauſe the ſafety and felicity of men depend upon it, and therefore whatever is Deſtructive of Peace, is a Violation of the Law of Nature, the <hi>Bill of Excluſion</hi> would Deſtroy our Peace, therefore it is a Violation to the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>That of two evils or calamities the leaſt is to be choſen, is a prime Principle of Nature, here are two evils, a Popiſh Succeſſour (as is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed) a <hi>Project</hi> to <hi>Exclude</hi> or keep him out; That but feared, it being not certain that his Royal Highneſs is a Papiſt, or if he be ſo now, that he will continue ſo, it being poſſible (if the Nation would treat him with the Honour due unto him) that he may be converted, or if that happen not, that he may leave this World before his Royal Brother: The other evil is a device to <hi>Exclude</hi> or deprive him of his Right (which I have proved to be a moral evil, and being ſo, is upon no terms to be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, but utterly abhorr'd and rejected) but if we wave the ſinfulneſs of it, and conſider it in point of prudence, this Device, if paſſed into a Law will be a preſent and a great Calamity, becauſe it will heighten the confuſions and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions of the Nation, put it to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, bring upon it (as I obſerv'd before) the miſery of a ſtanding Army, enrage and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe our Enemies abroad, exaſperate, and make thoſe we have at home deſperate; ſo that the Project of <hi>Excluſion</hi> (ſetting aſide the Sinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:44080:117"/> of it) is a greater temporal Evil or Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity than a Popiſh Succeſſour, becauſe that is preſent, this only feared, and therefore fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>The miſeries feared from a Popiſh Succeſſour may be only feared or imagin'd, not felt, he may if he pleaſes ſerve God his own way, and let us enjoy the Religion Eſtabliſh'd. If not ſo, yet the miſeries conſequent to the ſetting up the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion, will not be comparable to the calamities of a War, which the <hi>Excluding</hi> him will produce; that way a few (in compariſon of what a War will deſtroy) may Suffer, this way the whole Kingdom, nay all the Three Kingdoms will be imbroil'd and ruin'd, that way ſome may fall Martyrs and ſo dye ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably here, and live gloriouſly in Heaven, this way great numbers will be cut off in the damnable Sin of Rebellion, and ſo periſh ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully here, and eternally in Hell; ſo that a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Succeſſour is a leſſer evil, a more tolerable calamity than the <hi>Bill of Excluſion,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this is to be laid aſide, and that left to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</p>
               <p>But every man ('tis ſaid) hath a Right to his Plank in a Shipwrack, ſuppoſing that, yet here is no Shipwrack, but what mens idle (if not worſe) fears ſuggeſt, and would it not be Egregious Knavery for ſome of the Mariners to caſt the Pilate overboard, becauſe they have a wild Suſpition, that he will run the Ship upon a Rock on purpoſe to ſink himſelf and them. Beſides, though every man be allow'd to do all that is juſt and innocent for his own Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:44080:118"/> yet there are ſome Perſons that muſt not have any injury or violence done them for any cauſe whatſoever, becauſe the great Author of the Law of Nature forbids it, ſaying, <hi>Touch not mine Anoynted:</hi> No Provocation can ever make it Lawful for a Son to aſſault his Father, nor for a Subject to reſiſt his Prince, becauſe that is contrary to Nature, this deſtructive to Civil Society, of which he is born a Member, and which he is indiſpenſably obliged by the Law of Nature to preſerve.</p>

No, no! inſtead of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, it ſunk the Ship, turn'd their ſo craftily pretended into a real danger, involv'd their whole Nation in the greateſt and moſt deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Ruin or Deſtruction, and that by the <hi>Romans,</hi> that ever any People Suffer'd, or any Hiſtory Related, thereby warning all Kingdoms and Nations to take heed of ſuch wicked <hi>Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients,</hi> never to do any unjuſt thing for the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding any danger how great or real ſoever, or to ſeek the Publick Safety by oppreſſing or

               <p>So that the <hi>Bill of Excluſion</hi> is contrary to the Law of Nature, as well as to the Law of Chriſt, and as this forbids, ſo that condemns it, and therefore it cannot be agreable to Natural Juſtice, unleſs they mean that of Mr <hi>Hobs,</hi> who repreſents the Humane to be as ſavage and barbarous as the Brutiſh Nature, and affirms that Men have no obligations upon them to do juſtly, but what humane Laws lay upon them, but that all Men have a natural Right to do every thing they pleaſe, and that to all Perſons, for which, and all his other lewd and impious Aſſertions he hath been ſufficiently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved and bafled by divers learned and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Perſons: The <hi>Bill of Excluſion</hi> may be acknowledg'd (if that be any honour to it) to be agreeable to this Wild and Atheiſtical Juſtice, but Chriſtianity condemns, and Right Reaſon abhors it.</p>

               <p>The Offence you have commited againſt God: <hi>For doth not he love righteouſneſs and hate iniquity, and require that all men, eſpecially Magiſtrates, do juſtly, and love mercy, and walk humbly with him?</hi> But this Device of yours is a manifeſt contradiction to all theſe. 'Tis to oppreſs and rob an innocent perſon of his Right, to offer him that hard Meaſure, which you would by no means have done to your ſelves, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>to do unjuſtly.</hi> 'Tis to treat an erring perſon (for ſuch his Royal Highneſs is, if he be a Papiſt) with the greateſt rigor or ſeverity, to ruin, or make him miſerable in this, becauſe he is become (as you believe) a Proſelyte to that Church, which he (if he be of it) thinks (though erroneouſly) will guide him ſafely to the Eternal Glory and Happineſs of the other World, and therefore is moſt <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merciful!</hi> If any man Err from the truth, Charity prompts and obligeth us to endeavour his Converſion, and to reſtore him in the Spirit of meekneſs, with all mildneſs and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſs to ſhew him his miſtake, and repreſent to him the evil and dangerous conſequences of it, that he may hate and forſake it. But your attempt to <hi>Exclude</hi> the Duke doth not deſign his Converſion, but Deſtruction, leaves him no place for Repentance, but intends his Ruin, and therefore is Cruel not Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.</p>
               <pb n="205" facs="tcp:44080:120"/>
               <p>Amongſt the many praiſes they adorn'd it with, ſome of the Admirers of it, I remember, commended this Device for the <hi>mercy</hi> of it; An Elogium deſtitute of all ſhadow or appearance of Truth, becauſe the puniſhment it would inflict is worſe than Death; for a brave and valiant Prince, as his Royal Highneſs is, had rather dye than ſurvive the loſs of a Crown, which is his Right by Birth, if he ſurvive his preſent Majeſty, than to be degraded from, and unjuſtly depriv'd of the higheſt Dignity and Honour upon Earth, to ſee another leap over his Head, get into that Throne, wear the Royal Diadem, and poſſeſs the Kingdoms he was born to, muſt needs be a continual grief, trouble, and vexation to him, and make him weary of his Life: Such Iniury and Diſgrace would be intolerable, and cauſe him to dye daily, to linger out a tedious Life; but Death would ſoon put a period to all his miſeries, and conduct him to that bleſſed place, where they that ſuffer wrongfully here, ſhall be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rewarded: when a Man hath no juſt claim to any thing that the World admires and calls great or glorious, the want of it cannot reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably create him any trouble or diſcontent, but he is as well pleas'd with, and thinks himſelf as happy in his low condition, as others are in the higheſt and moſt honourable ſtations upon Earth, but to be depoſed or caſt down from that Empire or Soveraignty, which his Illuſtrious Anceſtors enjoy'd before him, and not ſuffer'd to Inherit the Throne of his Fathers, to be laid aſide as unworthy to poſſeſs the
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:44080:121"/> Kingdom he was born to, this muſt needs be an Hell upon Earth, the greateſt or moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect miſery any Man living can endure, that hath nothing to comfort or ſupport, to ſweeten or eaſe it, and therefore muſt needs be moſt rigorous and cruel. If this be mercy, God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver every Man from it.</p>
               <p>And being a contradiction to that Juſtice and Mercy he requires, it cannot poſſibly be conſiſtent with the other great duty, <hi>the walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing humbly with God:</hi> For what is that, but to ſubmit unto his will in all things, to reſign our ſelves to his diſpoſal, to depend upon his wiſe and gracious providence in the uſe of law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful means, in all dangers to hope in his mercy, to put our truſt and confidence in his Power and Goodneſs, not doubting but he careth for us, and will, ſo far as he ſees it conducive to his honour, and our good, deliver us from all dangers and ſufferings: This is to walk humbly and religiouſly, and ſo, as all pious and holy Men have in all Ages walked with God. But your <hi>Project of Excluſion</hi> is a Defiance to all this, a plain Declaration that you dare not truſt God with your Religion, your Lives, and Eſtates, nor commit them to his care and keeping, but prefer your own evil Inventions before his gracious Protection, admire your ſinful Policy more than his holy Wiſdome, as if he was either ignorant of, or unable to ſave us from the cruel deſigns of our Enemies, or cared not what becomes of us, or as if that which is an open affront to, or violation of his righteous Laws, could Miniſter to the ſafety
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:44080:121"/> or defence of the Nation. If this be not an high offence againſt God, I know not what is, or can be ſo?</p>
               <p>Nor have you offended onely againſt God, but againſt his Anoynted too, done all you could to draw the King to be a Partner in your Injuſtice, courted him to give his Royal Aſſent to your <hi>Bill,</hi> with liberal offers, and when they prevail'd not, attempted to conſtrain or force him to it, by denying him the neceſſary ſupplies, which his great Affairs requir'd, and the danger the Nation was in exacted from you. Are not theſe high and heighnous offences? Is it not a great ſin to intice or tempt any Man, much more your Prince, to an unjuſt action, and when no allurement could perſwade, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindful of all reverence to God and Him, To attempt to neceſſitate, or compel him to do it. Theſe things look black and dreadful, and I need not tell you whoſe works they are, the Author of them is eaſily known, and no Chriſtian ſure can be ambitious to invade his hateful office. The trouble, vexation, and diſquiet, which you have created the King by your reſolute adherance to it, deſerve to be conſider'd too: For how many cares, fears, and ſad thoughts, hath this your undutiful be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour towards him produced in his Royal Soul? Is this the love you have for, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quital you render him, for all his Care of, and Royal Favours to you, and all the Eminent Bleſſings which God by him hath confer'd upon the Nation, to do what in you lies to rob him of all his tranquillity and content, and to make
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:44080:122"/> him weary of his Life? Is this the Honour God commands you to ſhew, the Obedience he bids you pay to his Anoynted, to preſs and urge him in ſuch an unbecoming manner to the moſt diſhonourable Act; and to perſiſt Stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornly in it, when he reproved you for, and declared his abhorrence of it? 'Tis as plain then as any thing can be, that you neither fear'd God nor the King, but ſinn'd againſt both, in preſſing with ſuch reſtleſs importunity this unjuſt Device.</p>
               <p>'Tis to ſin againſt the Duke too, not only as it offers him the higheſt injury and injuſtice, but alſo as it confirms him in his Errour (if he be a Papiſt,) and tempts him to be ſo, though he was none before: Confirms him in his Errour, if he be really a Proſeyte to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> for will he not rejoyce that he hath withdrawn himſelf from Men that walk ſo diſorderly, that have ſo little fear of God, as to do the unjuſt and evil things he hates, ſo little Faith, that they dare not truſt him with their Religion, but ſeek to preſerve it by baſe and unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Arts, are ſo cowardly impatient, and unchriſtian, that they will do a great and certain Injury to avoyd an uncertain one, ruin him now for fear they ſhould ſuffer here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
               <p>But if on the otherſide his Royal Highneſs was no Papiſt, the treating him with ſuch cruelty and unjuſtice muſt needs be a mighty temptation to make him ſo; for had he not reaſon to draw this Inference from your at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to <hi>Exclude</hi> him, If Proteſtants uſe
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:44080:122"/> their Princes in this manner, 'tis fafer to be a Papiſt? My glorious Father was Murder'd, my Royal Brother made an Exile by them, and forced to wander in Forreign Countries, and now their malice is grown ſo virulent and cruel againſt me, without any juſt cauſe or provocation at all (I having Injured none of them) that they would deprive me of my Birthright, and proſcribe or baniſh me as an. Enemy to my Native Country: I have no way then to ſecure my ſelf from the danger that threaten me, but to leave the Proteſtants, and joyn my ſelf to the Papiſts, who 'tis poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible may treat me as juſtly and honourably, as they have done deſpitefully and cruelly. This Concluſion is natural from your Premiſes, though I hope, and believe his Royal Highneſs is more Pious, Juſt, and Prudent, than to be either tempted by it to ſuch a change, or to impute this Impious Project to all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proteſtants, as if they were favourers or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provers of it; The Right Honourable the Houſe of Lords, and all the Loyal Addreſſers, and Abhorrers have given him full ſatisfaction to the contrary, but as for you, it cannot be deny'd, but you have given him great Scandal, brought Reproach not onely upon your ſelves, but all the Profeſſors of the Reformed Religion in this Nation, done enough to make him hate the very name of Proteſtant for ever, and thereby incurr'd the <hi>Woe</hi> denounc'd by our Lord againſt them by whom <hi>Offences come.</hi>

Theſe are the known Arts and Wiles of the Devil, it was neither wiſe nor ſafe for him to prompt them to ſuch an helliſh Treaſon and Murder at firſt, and therefore he began with ſome preparatory Principles, which he knew would by degrees drive them to, and ingage them in this, which were ſuch as theſe, That the ſtrict Rules of Juſtice are to be diſpens'd with; for the defence and ſecurity of true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; That nothing is unlawful that is conducive to ſo good an end; That a Popiſh Prince ought not upon any terms to be intruſted with the Government of a Proteſtant Kingdom, what ever Right or Title he may have to it. Theſe brought on the <hi>Bill of Excluſion,</hi> put you upon that Reſolve, That there was no way to deliver the Nation from Popery, but to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive

From hence came alſo your frequent Clubs and Conſults, in which the violent and eager Men of your Party (as is now evident) <hi>took Councel together againſt the Lord and againſt his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed.</hi> Theſe were the ſteps by which the wicked Contrivers of it, deſcended into this Abyſſe or Depth of wickedneſs, theſe were the Arts and Methods that led to this deteſtable <hi>Conſpiracy,</hi> becauſe the King would not conſent to the <hi>Excluding</hi> his Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the bloody Villains reſolved to <hi>Exclude,</hi>
                  <pb n="215" facs="tcp:44080:126"/> or ſend them both out of the World by a barbarous Aſſaſination.</p>
               <p>I believe divers of you are Innocent of this black and great offence, and do heartily ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor it, but it cannot be deny'd that this <hi>Project of Excluſion</hi> hath produced, or cauſed this Treaſon. To ſay you did not intend it, may in ſome of you be acknowledg'd to be true, but then you ſhould have conſider'd how dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous (as well as ſinful) it is to venture upon any unjuſt or unlawful means for the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any good whatſoever, becauſe errour is a boundleſs thing, and when men are once drawn into it, they know not where to ſtop, but run on ſtill, proceed from bad to worſe, fall from one wickedneſs to another, and never come into Gods Righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p>So that it is the higheſt wiſdome, as well as his indiſpenſable duty, for every Man to keep innocency, and take heed to the thing that is Right, to do no evil nor unjuſt thing upon any inducement, or for any end whatſoever, becauſe, whatever happens in the mean time, this will be ſure to bring a man Peace and Salvation at the laſt. God hath given us a moſt juſt and holy Law to live by, teaching us, as all Piety to Him, ſo all Loyalty to his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynted, actually to obey all our Princes Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful commands, and patiently to ſuffer what puniſhments he is pleaſed to inflict for our non-performance of thoſe things, which he requires in oppoſition to the Law of God, if at any time through Errour or Miſtake he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe any ſuch. This promotes the Honour and
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:44080:127"/> Glory of God, the Safety and Felicity of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and the Peace or Tranquillity of the World. They that keep to this rule can never ſuffer as Traytors and Evil-doers, but if they ſuffer at all, it muſt be for Well-doing, for their obedience to God and his Laws, and then moſt happy or bleſſed are they, becauſe they will have the joys and comfort of a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to eaſe and ſweeten their Sufferings, and God will ſupport them under them, and give them a great reward in his Heavenly Kingdom. Every Man that doth his duty to God and his Prince, that commits himſelf to the care and keeping of the Almighty by a juſt and pious Converſation, hath all the ſafety and ſecurity that can poſſibly be had, or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably deſir'd in this World, for if God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tects any, theſe in all probability are the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that may expect, and obtain that favour from him. Beſides, what temptation or inducement can Princes have to oppreſs or injure, to ruin or deſtroy good, peaceable, and harmleſs People, that pay them all due ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and obey them as far as is conſiſtent with their duty to God? None, none at all, which makes the Apoſtle ſay, <hi>Who is he that</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 St. Pet. 3. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>will harm you, if you be followers of that which is Good?</hi> Every Man that hath any Religion or fear of God will be both afraid and aſhamed to do it, for if he Perſecute and Deſtroy ſuch Innocent People, they ſhall be ſaved and ſhine with Chriſt in Heavenly Glory, but he ſhall ſuffer the terrours of an evil Conſcience, ly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſenſe of Gods diſpleaſure here, and
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:44080:127"/> when he Paſſes out of this World, (Cruelty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing commonly ſhort lived,) have an intolerable portion with the Unjuſt and Oppreſſors, with the Blood Thirſty and Perſecutors, in the black Regions of Eternal Sorrow and Miſery. But when Men ſeek to ſave or ſecure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from dangers (whether real or imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary) by unjuſt or unlawfull means (ſuch as this <hi>Project of Excluſion</hi> is) theſe inſtead of aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, invite and haſten their approach, nay multiply and increaſe them, inſtead of making a way for them to eſcape, intangle them ſo, that they grow deſperate, and reſolve upon the moſt bloody, villanous, and wicked En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizes, ſuch as this Treaſon is. For beſides that it is an open affront and defiance to all the Laws of God, the breaking all thoſe Sacred Bonds aſunder, with which he ties the hands of Subjects from doing violence to his Anoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, an inſolent ſlighting the dreadful Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and moſt terrible Puniſhments he hath inflicted upon ſuch preſumptuous Sinners, as if they thought Heaven had waſted all its Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery, ſpent all its Thunderbolts upon the Traytors of former times, and had no Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance in ſtore for them that now Conſpire the Death of Princes, or elſe believed the Righteous God was ſo partiall as to diſcover and puniſh none but Popiſh Traitors, ſo that they might commit the ſame execrable crime in Zeal againſt Popery, and be, if not innocent, yet ſafe, and have no harm, nor danger happen to them, Beſides this contempt, I ſay, of Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands and Judgments, thoſe forbidding Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:44080:128"/> as a crime moſt damnable, theſe confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Traitors, and hurrying them away to Hell with a ſwift and dreadful deſtruction, how have thoſe of your Party ingaged in this barbarous Conſpiracy, ſhamed all your former Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and Pretences? For was not this the great Plea for your <hi>Bill of Excluſion,</hi> the mighty Argument with which you preſſ'd the Paſſing, and thought to juſtifie or maintain the Lawfulneſs of it, That it was the <hi>only Expedient,</hi> as to ſuppreſs Popery, ſo to ſave the King, to preſerve his moſt precious life from the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery and Cruelty of that Faction. You made the Nation believe, that you could be content to run all hazards, to expoſe your ſelves to all dangers, to endure any hardſhips or miſeries, if the King was but ſafe, and guarded from the hands of violence, and all the bloody attempts of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Party. Theſe things looked fair and plauſible, and ſome that loved the King thought them real, and were deluded into a good opinion of your Proceedings, but now the Maſque is off, and thoſe of you that were ingaged in this Helliſh deſign, have no Cloak nor Covering for their Treachery, for, <hi>though their words were ſofter than butter, yet they had War in their hearts, though their ſpeeches were kind and fair, ſmoother than oyl, yet were they very Swords:</hi> They tender of the Kings moſt precious life, and ſtudious to preſerve him from harm and danger? Who can, or will believe it? If they were ſo then, why did they Plot to deſtroy him ſince? What hath the King done to merit or deſerve their wrath? If they really deſign'd
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:44080:128"/> and deſired his Preſervation before, why did they reſolve to Murder him now? Had not the King as great Reaſon as they to conſult his own ſafety, and doth not the admirable wiſdom he ſhews in the conduct of all his great Affairs, demonſtrate him beſt able to judg what ways and methods would be moſt conducive to the attaining ſo deſirable an end? So that their Plotting his deſtruction ſince proclaims to all the World, that they did not realy deſire to ſave him from the Papiſts then, or if they did, that it was becauſe they intended to kill him themſelves, and that in the ſame manner the Papiſts deſign'd to deſtroy him, even by ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, to come upon him unawares, and <hi>cut him off from amongſt the living,</hi> which is moſt Treacherous and Baſe, Curſed Cruelty and Cowardiſe joyn'd together. A Brave and Valiant Enemy would ſcorn to treat the moſt hated perſon ſo, or to rob any Man of ſuch a Jewel as his Life in ſuch a vile and ſneaking manner; Men of any Courage or Gallantry (though wicked) could not be ſo baſe Spirited as to ſteal upon two of the braveſt Princes in the World, and knock them on the head: But this is right <hi>Fanatick</hi> Practiſe, for that ſavage and barbarous Faction is both moſt cruel and baſe, it thirſts after and delights in Blood, the Blood of Princes, and attempts to ſhed it by Surpriſe and Treachery.</p>
               <p>And if enquiry be made, what moved them to this execrable Conſpiracy, what irritated or inraged them thus againſt the King, it will be found to be nothing but pure Malice, that
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:44080:129"/> they had no ill uſage offer'd, no provocation given to tempt them to ſuch a wickedneſs; for the King is Inferiour to none of his Renowned Anceſtors in Juſtice, Mercy, Kindneſs to, and Care of his People, the Laws are the meaſures of his Government, he neither exhauſts his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects by Arbitrary Exactions, nor conſumes them by Needleſs Wars, but is pleas'd to make it his conſtant Care and Study to Preſerve them in Piety, Peace, and Plenty. What deteſtable Villany and Ingratitude is it then, for any of his People to requite his Love with Hatred, the moſt Cruel and Deadly Hatred, to Conſpire to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether not to let him Live, under whoſe Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, Mild, and Equal Government they are bleſſed above all the People of the World, and happy to the admiration of all their Neighbour Nations.</p>
               <p>'Tis true indeed, no Injuries, Oppreſſions, or Cruelties from their Prince, can ever War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, or make it Lawful for Subjects to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire his Death, or to take Arms againſt him, <hi>for if they reſiſt</hi> (much more if they invade or aſſault him) St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells them <hi>they ſhall receive to themſelves Damnation:</hi> But yet when their Treaſons are cauſleſs and unprovoked, as this was, they muſt needs be moſt Wicked and Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, becauſe they have nothing but the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and meer Malice to inſtigate the Impious Wretches to them.</p>
               <p>And if this execrable Treaſon had ſucceeded, what a deplorable Condition had the People been in? Inſtead of a moſt juſt and merciful Prince, who Loves, and is a Father to them,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:44080:129"/> they had been Slaves to, and groan'd under the Cruelties and Oppreſſions of God knows how many mercileſs Tyrants: The City, in which Juſtice uſed to Reign, would have been full of Bloud and Violence: The Country where the happy People injoy'd their Eſtates in peace and ſafety, would have been turned into a Den of Thieves and Murderers. When this doleful Tragedy had been noyſed abroad, all the Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and Good People of the Nation would have been ſeiz'd with Horrour and Amazement, drown'd in Tears, expres'd their deep and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement Sorrow with hideous Outcries and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations, have filled Heaven and Earth with Complaints and doleful Exclamations: Their Ruin too would have been great and inevitable, their Lives expoſed to the armed Violence, their Eſtates to the inſatiable Rapine and Avarice of thoſe bloody Villains that kill'd the King; For they that could have the heart to ſmite the Shepherd, would they have took any Pity of, or have Spared the Flock? No, no! The Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Party would have taſted the ſame bitter fate with their Prince, their bloudy Swords would have made havock of all that ſtood in their way, Death and Slaughter would have Reign'd eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where, the whole Nation would have been an <hi>Aceldama,</hi> a great burying place. The <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Iriſh</hi> Maſſacres, and all the Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, of Ancient and Modern times, had been petty things in compare with this black Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, a Conſpiracy ſo execrable and villanous, that it will exceed the Faith of the next, as,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:44080:130"/> much as it doth the Expreſſion of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Age.</p>
               <p>And if you will according to our Saviours Rule (which is the ſureſt way of Judging) <hi>judg of the Tree by the Fruit it bears,</hi> you cannot but ſee how impious your <hi>Project of Excluſion is,</hi> that hath brought forth ſuch fruit, prompted ſome of the Zealots for it, with other Wicked Wretches, to ſuch a damnable Conſpiracy as this, which would (if not prevented by the Infinite goodneſs of God) have cut off the King and his Royal Highneſs, undone all his good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and ruin'd Three flouriſhing Kingdoms, that would have <hi>Excluded</hi> or Baniſh'd all Peace, Piety, and Happineſs, and let in Prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Oppreſſion, and Miſery.</p>
               <p>So that if you will ſpeak the Truth, you muſt acknowledg your crime to be exceeding great, in making choice of ſuch a ſinful <hi>Expedient,</hi> and if you deſire to be forgiven, your Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance muſt be equal to your Crime, that is, you muſt confeſs and forſake it.</p>
               <p>Confeſs it to God, and beſeech him to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give the great Offence you have committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him.</p>
               <p>Go to the King, and humbly beg his Pardon, that you ſhould cauſe him ſo much danger, bring his moſt precious Life into ſo great Peril, that you ſhould adviſe or propoſe any thing, that miniſter'd occaſion or temptation to violent and blood thirſty men, to attempt any thing ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther againſt his Perſon or Government: or that you ſhould do any thing to create trouble and vexation to his Royal Soul, or deſtroy his quiet
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:44080:130"/> and tranquillity. Let him know how much you are grieved for theſe your Errours and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, and that you ſhould be aſhamed to live, but that you hope his Royal Clemency will forgive, and your unfeigned Loyalty for the future make reparation for what you have done amiſs.</p>
               <p>Go to his Royal Highneſs, and confeſs the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid injuries, the high and ſhameful injuſtice you have offer'd him, that forgetting the Honour due to him as a Prince, you have treated him moſt rudely and deſpitefully, ſo that by the Law of Retaliation he might return the ſame ſevere meaſure to you, that you have tender'd to him, that as you have proudly and diſdain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſaid of him, as the ſtubborn <hi>Jews</hi> did of Chriſt, <hi>We will not have this Man Rule over us,</hi> ſo he, if he ever come to be King, may ſay concerning you with the Prince in the Goſpel <hi>But thoſe mine enemies, which would not that I</hi>

                  <hi>ſhould Reign over them, bring them hither, and ſlay them before me.</hi> 'Tis certain that by your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt and unworthy behaviour towards him, you have given the Duke great provocation, which nothing but Repentance can appeaſe, for when nothing elſe can do it, Submiſſion and Sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Acknowledgment of the errour or offence committed will pacifie a brave and generous perſon, as his Royal Highneſs is. Let this then be your method, go to him, and acknowledg the injuries you have done him, and humbly beg his pardon, beſeech him as <hi>Shimei</hi> did King <hi>David, not to impute iniquity to you,</hi> neither to remember what you did perverſly in the days
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:44080:131"/> of fear and danger, when the rumours of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, and the diſcovery of the horrid Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy of the Papiſts frighted you almoſt out of your wits, tell him that men in a great fright are apt to run into extravagancies, neither know, nor conſider what they do, but ſay and do ſuch things, which at other times they would be aſhamed of, humbly repreſent to him that ſome allowances are to be made you upon that account, and though nothing can excuſe, yet his generoſity can, and you hope will forgive the high offences you have committed againſt him, which if he pleaſe to do, you will never more provoke or injure, but love, honour, and treat him as the Son, and Brother of a King, and Heir apparent to theſe three Kingdoms. This is all the reparation you can make, the beſt ſatisfaction you can give him for your paſt offence, and if you do this, there is no doubt but he will forgive you. Princes reſemble their glorious Founder, both in their Power to puniſh, and their proneneſs to forgive the injuries and indignities that are committed againſt them, and as Repentance renders him Merciful and Propitious, turns away his Diſpleaſure, ſo it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites their Compaſſion, and pacifies their Wrath; but as God will not, ſo they have no obligation to Pardon thoſe that againſt all Reaſon and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion Sin againſt them, and when they have done it, refuſe to Repent. That you have done the firſt, highly injured his Royal Highneſs, is as evident as any thing can be; Be ſure then to make your Repentance as publick as your crime hath been, and do not doubt but it will
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:44080:131"/> be effectual to obtain your pardon. The Duke can, and will forgive you upon your hearty ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for, and humble confeſſion of your of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and you reproach and injure him more, if you think he hath, or will ſhew no mercy, than you have done by your paſt misbehaviour towards him, though your Sin againſt him be high and hainous, yet do not ſay with <hi>Cain, it is greater than can be forgiven,</hi> for this appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion (I believe) prompted the Zealots of your Party (whom their guilt made deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate) to conſpire his Death, according to the known Maxim of the wicked Politicians, who ſay, <hi>That bad Actions muſt be ſeconded with worſe, and leſſer injuries purſued with greater,</hi> the inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious perſon not thinking himſelf ſafe, till he hath taken from the injur'd all poſſibility of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge: What barbarous, nay deviliſh me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods are theſe, without any povocation or cauſe at all to wrong an Innocent Prince, and then for fear they ſhould at one time or other be called to account for it, ſeek to ſecure themſelves by doing him a greater; Firſt againſt all the Rules of Juſtice, the Dictates of right Reaſon, and the Laws of Religion, attempt to rob him of his Birth-right, and when that wicked imagination did not proſper or take ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, inſtead of Repenting of it, conſult or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree together to take away his Life, becauſe the dead cannot revenge the injuries that are done them: But is there then no God that judgeth in the Earth? Or if there be, doth not he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold ungodlineſs and wrong, that he may take the matter into his hand; puniſh the accurſed
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:44080:132"/> Authors of them with dreadful inflictions here, or if for reaſons unknown to us, he forbear them now, with the moſt horrible damnation hereafter. Such men as theſe are ſo far from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the high and noble Precepts of Chriſt the meaſures of their Actions, that they fall ſhort of the lower Juſtice, Mercy, and Integrity of the Heathens; nay proceed according to the wild, Villanous, and Atheiſtical Principles of the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viathan,</hi> and inſtead of reproving their dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable practices by producing the words of Chriſt, or any of his Apoſtles, I may beſpeak them in thoſe of that wiſe and honeſt Heathen <hi>Diphilus</hi> the Comoedian, <gap reason="foreign">

The puniſhment of ſuch men lingers &amp; is defer'd for a time, but it will be ſure to come, and that the heavier at laſt, and by its greatneſs make amends for the ſlowneſs of its approach. And therefore that neither the horrour of your Offence, nor your fears of Puniſhment make you deſperate, and puſh you on to ſuch dreadful crimes as they prompted the Conſpirators to, take the firſt opportunity to reconcile your ſelves to his Royal Highneſs, by confeſſing the injuries you have done him, and begging his pardon for them; but then you muſt not only confeſs, but renounce and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake them, meddle no more, I mean, with the Succeſſion, but caſt your <hi>Bill</hi> out of Doors, as a monſtrous and abominable Brat, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd

               <p>Be careful to undeceive the People too, whom by your mighty Zeal for, and reſolute Adherence to it, you have drawn to an high eſteem and admiration of your <hi>Projects</hi> of <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion,</hi> and thereby prepared for Tumults, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, and all manner of violent and unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Practiſes. Your Votes are of ſuch Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority with all the factious and diſcontented people, that they think them, if not equal to Holy Scripture, yet the beſt Commentary upon it, and will follow your Marginal Notes rather than the ſacred Text: Conſider then what a dangerous thing it is to inſtil bad Principles into the People, who are of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves too prone to run into Errours and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancies, and therefore inſtead of Goads to excite, they need Bridles to reſtrain them from them: That they who are apt to think juſtice or honeſty a ſuperfluous or needleſs ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue now under the Goſpel, and perſwade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that Chriſt fulfil'd all Righteouſneſs on purpoſe to free thoſe that believe in him from the practice of it, will be Confirm'd in their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious Errour, when they ſee iniquity eſtabliſh'd by Law, and a moſt unjuſt thing done for the Defence and Security of Reformed Chriſtianity: Nay, which is more horrid, ſome will think,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:44080:133"/> that which Men call Religion, no Divine Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, but meer Humane Invention, becauſe if it come from God, the profeſſors of it may ſafely commend or commit it to his Protection, his Care and Keeping, it being moſt reaſonable to ſuppoſe, that he loves his own Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and is concern'd in honour to preſerve them from the attempts of thoſe that ſeek to deſtroy them: But when Men are ſo buſy and forward to ſupport and ſecure their Religion by unjuſt and evil Arts, think it ſo weak and helpleſs a thing that it is not able to ſhift for it ſelf, to maintain or keep its ground without the aſſiſtance of ſinful and unlawful ſuccours, This tempts the ſuſpicious to think it a meer humane invention; for if it be of God, it needs no ſin to uphold it, and they who do evil in defence of it, incur his wrath as <hi>Uzzah</hi> did, who put forth his hand to ſtay the tottering Ark, which he apprehended to be falling. Nothing of divine inſtitution can poſſibly fall or periſh, ſo long as the Almighty Author of it is pleas'd to uphold and protect it, but when he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draws his ſupport, and it is his pleaſure that it fall, all the power and policy of Men cannot keep it up, though they uſe the beſt and moſt pious methods to that purpoſe. Princes and Magiſtrates 'tis certain may &amp; ought to do every thing that is juſt and innocent, for the ſafety of the true Religion, but if they uſe any wicked or forbidden means to protect and defend it, theſe by the juſt Judgments of God increaſe the danger, both haſten and render the fall of it

               <p>Now whatever Errours either of Judgement or Practice, this Device of yours leads any of the People into, and whatever Ruin or Miſeries they thereby bring upon themſelves, either in this World or in the other, all theſe you are anſwerable, and will be called to a ſad recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning for, if not before, yet in that great day when <hi>the Righteous God ſhall bring every work into Judgement, with every ſecret thing whether it be good or evil,</hi> if you do not prevent it in time by rectifying their miſtakes, and changing their opinions of it, which you may eaſily do, by repreſenting to them faithfully and plainly the great Jnjuſtice and Impiety of it, that <hi>Religion</hi> Condemns, <hi>Right Reaſon and common Honeſty</hi> Forbids it, that it is <hi>Evil</hi> in it ſelf, <hi>Dangerous</hi> to the King, and <hi>Miſchievous</hi> to the People, and therefore to be <hi>abhor'd</hi> not <hi>admired, rejected,</hi> not <hi>choſen:</hi> Such a Declaration as this from you will recover the People out of the Errour and Snare into which you have drawn them, and reclaim them from doting on it; but if you do it not, ſo long as they have your Perſons in Admiration, and cry up your Opinions as Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, they will be very difficultly, if at all, convinced of the Injuſtice of it, and you omit that which is neceſſary to compleat your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and conſequently to obtain your

As for the <hi>Romans</hi> there is no doubt but they will recover their loſt Soveraignty, and ſet up their Religion here if they can (though it be a great queſtion whether they can do it) and we ſhould be very much to blame, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh cheaply, if we do not uſe all fair and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful means to preſerve our ſelves, But as for thoſe that are unjuſt and ſinful (as I have proved this <hi>Project</hi> of yours to be) as they will do us no good, ſo we have no need to uſe them.</p>
               <p>For firſt, Is there no God, nor Providence? doth not he that made, Govern the World? Hath he no care of, nor concern for them that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs his Truth, and reverence or obey his Laws? That he is, you do not Queſtion; and you have no Reaſon to doubt the other, becauſe St. <hi>Peter</hi> expreſly affirms it, calling upon us to <hi>caſt our care upon him, becauſe he careth for us:</hi> Hath <note place="margin">1 Epiſt. 5. 7.</note> our Lord, who, when he was upon Earth, did with ſo much Labour, and ſo many Sufferings
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:44080:134"/> purchaſe to himſelf a Church and People, who loved and gave himſelf to Death, the cruel and reproachful Death of the Croſs for it, hath he, I ſay, no kindneſs for his Church, no care at all of it, now he is in Heaven? Doth the Glory in which he ſhines on the right hand of his Father, the Rapturous Joys and unconceivable Felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties he is there poſſeſs'd of, divert his thoughts or render him unmindful of his faithful Servants and devout Worſhippers upon Earth, ſo that he cares not what becomes of them? or if he bears them good will, loves and is kindly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected to them, is he ſo poor, ſo impotent a Prince, that he is not able to protect them? What Shame, and Folly, and Impiety is it to think ſo meanly and unworthily of him? He that when he was upon Earth, healed the Sick, raiſed the Dead, and did ſo many wonderful works, muſt needs now all Power is given him both in Heaven and Earth, be a moſt mighty Saviour and Deliverer? of his abillity then to help and defend us, there can be no queſtion or doubt at all: all the diſpute is whether he will do it? And to my apprehenſion thoſe words which St. <hi>Mathew</hi> relates as the laſt he ſpeaks upon Earth, have a favourable aſpect this way, <hi>Loe I am with you alway, even to the end of the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Chap. 28 20.</note> 
                  <hi>world:</hi> I am going from you, returning to the glorious place from whence I came, to take poſſeſſion of the Throne prepared for me in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but aſſure your ſelves that when I am there, I will be careful of you, though you have not my Bodily preſence, yet I will afford you my Protection and Aſſiſtance, for thoſe
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:44080:135"/> words, <hi>I will be with you,</hi> ſignifie commonly, will deliver you, as in that promiſe to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Jeremy, be not affraid of their faces, for I am with thee to deliver thee, ſaith the Lord:</hi> and <note place="margin">Chap, 1. 8.</note> St. <hi>Stephen</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> ſaith, <hi>God was with him,</hi> that is, as he explains it in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Acts 7. 9, 10.</note> words, <hi>deliver'd him out of all his afflictions.</hi> 'Tis true indeed, this (as all other temporal promiſes are) muſt be underſtood <hi>cum exceptio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne crucis,</hi> that Chriſt will be with, protect and deliver his Church and People from all dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and ſufferings, ſo far as is conſiſtent with his Honour and Glory, and the Intereſt of his Religion, when their Sufferings are neceſſary to do him Honour in the world, to recommend his Religion to others, and gain Converts to it, then he is <hi>With</hi> thoſe he makes choice of to be his Martyrs and Confeſſors to ſtrengthen and comfort, or inable them to bear their Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with Joy and Patience, with a thankful and quiet Submiſſion to his good will and pleaſure: And when his Sufferings can either do honour to Chriſt, or Service to his Religion, he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of the name of a Chriſtian, and can expect no portion in his Kingdom, that repines at, or ſeeks to decline them by Sinful means. This was the caſe of the Apoſtles, Chriſt was <hi>with them</hi> in the firſt ſenſe, to deliver them from many Dangers, and all their Enemies, till they had accompliſh'd their Miniſtry, preach'd the Goſpel to the World, appointed others to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed them in their great &amp; holy Office, left his Religion in ſuch a condition, that by his bleſſing and protection it was able not only to keep its
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:44080:135"/> ground, but to make new conqueſts and ſpread it ſelf farther in the World, but when this was done, and the time come for them to confirm or ſeal the truth of that, and to glorifie him by their Death, then he was <hi>with them</hi> in the other manner, to ſtrengthen and ſupport them in their Sufferings, to give them courage, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and reſolution to lay down their Lives to give Teſtimony to his Truth.</p>
               <p>And I ſee no reaſon why this promiſe ſhould be reſtrain'd only to the Apoſtles, becauſe all true Chriſtians have great need of this preſence of Chriſt, that he ſhould be with them hoth to protect and defend them from their Enemies, and to help or ſupport them in their Sufferings, and alſo becauſe the time mentioned in it reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es farther than the Age the Apoſtles Lived in, <hi>Loe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I am with you alway to the end of the world,</hi> which if it be underſtood in the narroweſt ſenſe thoſe words, <hi>the end of the World,</hi> are capable of, which is the deſtruction of the Jewiſh Nation by the <hi>Roman</hi> Army, yet none of the Apoſtles but St. <hi>John</hi> lived to ſee that dreadful period, and therefore it is moſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably to underſtand it of the Apoſtles and the then Chriſtians, whilſt they lived, and of all true Chriſtians in all Ages of the World, till time ſhall be no more.</p>
               <p>And if we of this Nation will but call to mind the former mercies and kindneſs of our Lord, in what an eminent manner he hath been <hi>with us</hi> ever ſince the Reformation, how gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly and wonderfully he hath guarded us from our cruel Enemies of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:44080:136"/> we can have no cauſe at all to diſtruſt him for the future. How were the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Faction en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged at our Anceſtours, becauſe renouncing their Errours, Superſtitions, and Innovations, they returned to the Pure and Primitive Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, and yet notwithſtanding all their rage, fury, and reſtleſs endeavours to deſtroy it, it ſtill continues, and I hope will do to the laſt period of the World. 'Tis true indeed Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s coming to the Crown (which ſhe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd notwithſtanding all the Arts and Methods that were uſed to <hi>Exclude</hi> her) obſcured and removed it for a time, ſo that it was publickly own'd only by the Martyrs and Confeſſors, but that, as was ſaid of the <hi>Julian</hi> Perſecution, was but a cloud and ſoon vaniſhed away, for her Reign was ſhort, and Popery in <hi>England</hi> died with her. For Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> ſucceeding her, Reſtored, Eſtabliſh'd, or moſt firmly Setled the Reformed Religion, to the great Joy of the Nation, and the indignation of <hi>Rome,</hi> for that Faction were ſo incens'd and provoked as to try all ways to deſtroy that glorious Princeſs, and with her our Religion, hence proceeded frequent Treaſons and Conſpiracies to Poyſon and Aſſaſſinate her, ſeveral Bulls from <hi>Rome,</hi> to forbid the Catholicks to come to our Churches, to Excommunicate the Queen, declare her fallen from all Dominion, to Abſolve her Subjects from their Allegiance, and Excite them to take Arms againſt and depoſe her. And ſuch was the rage of Pope <hi>Pius Quintus</hi> againſt her, that he declared he would be ready to aid in perſon, to ſpend all St. <hi>Peters</hi> Patrimony, all the Chali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:44080:136"/> and Croſſes of the Church, nay his very Cloaths to promote ſo good a work, as he thought her deſtruction to be: And when no clandeſtine or ſecret means ſucceeded, the King of <hi>Spain</hi> ſent his Invincible <hi>Armado</hi> as it was arrogantly, and (as appeared by the event) falſly called to invade, and take her Kingdom from her, but all in vain, for the gracious and watchful providence of God preſerv'd her, diſcover'd all the Treaſons, defeated all the Attempts that were made againſt her, ſo that ſhe died in peace and full of years.</p>
               <p>The ſame good providence did alſo protect her moſt excellent Succeſſor, King <hi>James,</hi> and the Parliament, from the Deſtruction intended for them, they being all by <hi>Romiſh</hi> Treachery and Cruelty appointed as ſheep for the ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the Conſpirators took all poſſible care to prevent diſcovery, ſo that it was little leſs than a Miracle that it was detected. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by diſappointed.</p>
               <p>But I need not look ſo far back, our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent moſt gracious Soveraign being an Illuſtrious Inſtance or Proof of the certainty of thoſe words of the Royal Prophet, <hi>Great deliverance</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 18. 50.</note> 
                  <hi>giveth he to his King, and ſheweth mercy to his Anoynted:</hi> For hath not a tender providence ſhrowded him under its Wings, and confer'd the moſt Eminent bleſſings and deliverances upon him? How many dangers hath he been in? was he ſafe in <hi>Scotland,</hi> when in the hands of thoſe Men that Rebelled againſt, and ruin'd his glorious Father? Was it not poſſible for him to have fell at <hi>Worceſter</hi> by a murdering Bullet,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:44080:137"/> or to be taken as he went off from that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Battell? Were there no ſearchings for, no rewards offer'd to them that could give in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation where the Royal Wanderer was? Was the Oake ſuch an Invincible fortreſs, ſuch a ſure defence, ſo ſafe an hiding place, as to afford him protection, if the power and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the moſt high had not guarded and overſhadowed him? And hath not the ſame providence that protected him then, placed him upon the Throne of his Fathers, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd him from thoſe two horrid <hi>Conſpiracies,</hi> that of the <hi>Romiſh,</hi> and this of the <hi>Fanatick</hi> or Common-wealth Faction?</p>
               <p>By all which you may know and ſee (if you do not wilfully ſhut your Eyes) that the Lord helpeth or ſaveth his Anoynted, that the Kings life is moſt dear and precious to him: That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides thoſe you ſee (and ſo unjuſtly murmur at) he hath an inviſible guard, the Angels of God, to be a Security and Defence to him. How then can the King be ſafer than under the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the Almighty, and why ſhould you doubt of his Future care of him, having ſuch experience of the paſt deliverances he hath bleſſed him with? That God, who hath been <hi>with,</hi> and ſo miraculouſly preſerv'd him all his life, will not withdraw his defence from him, unleſs the ſins of his People provoke him to it: And your preſſing His Majeſty to ſo unjuſt an Act as the paſſing your <hi>Bill,</hi> gives the World juſt cauſe to ſuſpect that you do not really deſire his ſafety, for that cannot be had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the protection of God, which is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:44080:137"/> only by the uſe of juſt and lawful means; And therefore if you ſincerely deſire it (as in duty and gratitude you are obliged) be not faithleſs but truſt in God, and depend upon his Providence, you ſee he hath ſaved his Anoynted, and therefore have reaſon to believe he will do it ſtill, eſpecially if you, and all his People make it their frequent and earneſt petition to him.</p>
               <p>For Secondly, is there no Efficacy in Prayer? Do the pious and devout Supplications of holy and good men Prevail nothing with God? Do they Call down no bleſſings from Heaven? Conduce nothing to the ſafety and welfare of thoſe that uſe them upon Earth? If not, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind have been ſadly deceiv'd; for in all Ages and Places of the World the conſtant cuſtom hath been to invocate or call upon God, and in all their dangers and neceſſities to make ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes to him, in hopes to be heard, protected, and ſupply'd by his Infinite Wiſdom, Power, and Goodneſs, for if this had not been their hope or expectation, they would never have done the other, for to what purpoſe ſhould men ſupplicate ſuch a Being as hath no kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for, and refuſes to help them, takes no notice of, makes no return to the petitions that are put up to him. 'Tis true indeed, moſt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the World have been ſo ignorant as to preſent their Prayers to a wrong Object, to invocate falſe and imaginary Deuties, that could neither hear nor help them, but they thought them to be wiſe and powerful, and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſors of all manner of bleſſings, otherwiſe
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:44080:138"/> they would never have gone to their Temples, nor approach'd their Altars, nor lifted up their hands, and hearts, and voices to them. But we, thanks be to God, underſtand better than to be guilty of ſuch groſs and impious Errours, we direct our Prayers to the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who is pleaſed to be called (as by one of his moſt eminent titles of honour,) <hi>a God hearing Prayer,</hi> and commands us to make our devout addreſſes to him, nay invites us to do it with great and gracious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, <hi>It ſhall come to paſs that before they call I</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Eſa. 65. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>will anſwer, and whilſt they are yet ſpeaking I will hear:</hi> So propenſe is the Divine Goodneſs to help all Pious People, that it will not ſtay to be asked, but prevents them many times with great and eminent bleſſings, and therefore much more will he do it when they humbly beg ſuch favours of him as their preſent exigences re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire. Are they in trouble or danger, <hi>Call upon me</hi> (ſaith this moſt merciful Being) <hi>in the time of trouble I will deliver thee, and thou ſhalt glorify me.</hi> And leſt any man ſhould think his condition not capable of help, ſuppoſe his dangers or wants too great to be averted or reliev'd by his Prayers, our Lord hath given us that moſt large and comprehenſive promiſe, <hi>verily, verily I ſay unto you, whatſoever ye ſhall ask the father in my name, he will give it you:</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">St. Jo. 16. 23.</note> Not every thing indefinitely, but whatſoever good thing, holy and good men rightly ask of him for a good End, he aſſures us God will give it, if the perſons praying be pious and holy, the things pray'd for juſt and lawful, the
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:44080:138"/> end for which they are deſired good, if they be asked in Faith with ſubmiſſion to his holy will and pleaſure, with a pious importunity and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon him, then the Prayer is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our Saviours promiſe, and of great ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy with God, ſo St. <hi>James</hi> affirms, <hi>The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Chap. 5. 16. Phil. 4. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>availeth much,</hi> is of ſuch mighty Power with God that St. <hi>Paul</hi> commands us, <hi>to be careful of nothing</hi> (not to vex or diſquiet, trouble or tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment our ſelves with dreadful apprehenſions of the dangers that threaten and incompaſs us, not to ſay, how ſhall we eſcape, what ſhall we do to decline the rage and cruelty of our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies) <hi>but in every thing by Prayer and Supplication with thanks-giving, let our requeſts be made known unto God,</hi> do but recommend your ſelves to God in holy and frequent Prayer, with thankful acknowledgments of his former Mercies, and you need trouble your ſelves no farther, but leave the event to him, who will either give you deliverance here, or that which is better and more deſirable, eternal happineſs and Salvation hereafter. The more and greater our dangers are, the more frequent and fervent our Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Devotions ought to be, for when all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther helps and means have failed, theſe have procured the moſt eminent bleſſings and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verances, the Church in all Ages hath experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced the benefit and advantage of them, for the Prayers of holy men have ſaved Cities and Kingdoms from Ruin, obtain'd Victories, done Miracles, ſhut and opened Heaven. By the Prayer of <hi>Moſes</hi> the <hi>Amalekites,</hi> the moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:44080:139"/> Enemies of the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were, vanquiſh'd; by the Prayer of <hi>Aſa</hi> the <hi>Ethiopi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> their moſt numerous Enemies were diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited; And by the Prayer of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> and <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah</hi> the vaſt Army of <hi>Sennacherib</hi> was deſtroy'd by an Angel, the Seige of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> raiſed, and he return'd into his own Land, where he fell by the Swords of his own Sons.</p>
               <p>And if the devout Prayers of holy men have been ſo advantageous and ſucceſsful in former Ages, how come they to have loſt their power and efficacy now, or to be of ſuch ſmall credit with Chriſtians, that they dare not truſt to them, and other lawful means, but ſeek to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure themſelves by thoſe that are ſinful and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous? May not we expect the ſame help and benefit by them, which they have afforded others in their dangers and diſtreſſes? yes cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly! And therefore let it be our care, as it is both our wiſdom and duty, to make uſe of theſe, to put up Supplications, Prayers, and Interceſſions; Firſt for the King, that God will give him along Life, a ſecure &amp; happy Reign, ſave or deliver him from all his Enemies, <hi>hide him from the gathering together of the froward, and from the Inſurrection of the wicked doers,</hi> diſcover and defeat all the Councels and Conſpiracies of Traytors, that they may fall into the Pit which at any time they dig, and be taken in the Snare which they are ſo Impious as to lay for him.</p>
               <p>For his Royal Highneſs, that God will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve him from the hands of Violence, from the cruel, bloudy Zeal of <hi>Fanatick</hi> Spirits, that
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:44080:139"/> he will be graciouſly pleaſed (if he be a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt) to inlighten him with the knowledg of the Truth, to convert him to this Pure and Holy Church, <hi>that he may be ſaved in the day of the Lord Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For our Religion, humbly beſeeching the great and glorious Author of it, that he will be pleaſed to preſerve and continue it to us, and our poſterity for ever, that though our ſinful and unſuitable lives deſerve ſo ſad and fearful a Judgment, yet that he will be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful to us, not ſuffer his Truth to fail a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt, nor his Goſpel to be taken from us. And that he will be pleaſed to keep us from diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honouring our Religion, by uſing any unjuſt or unlawful means for the Defence and Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, leſt whilſt we appear Zealous in ſuch a way for the true, we run into ſuch errours &amp; extravagancies, as will give the World juſt cauſe to think that we have really no Religion at all.</p>
               <p>If theſe things were piouſly and frequently recommended to the Divine Goodneſs, both in publick and private, by all that in this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion profeſs the Reformed Religion, we ſhould ſoon ſee the Bleſſed effects of, and obtain a Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious anſwer to ſuch Prayers. And therefore before we trouble our ſelves about any more, let us try this moſt excellent <hi>Expedient,</hi> which hath in all Ages done ſuch wonders in the World, let us make our devout <hi>Addreſſes</hi> to Heaven as conſtant as we apprehend our dangers either are, or may be: Let the Houſes of God, the ſacred Places ſet a part for Prayer or Invocation of his name be more frequented and reſorted
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:44080:140"/> to, <hi>Let us go into his Sanctuary, and fall low upon our Knees before his footſtool, lifting up unto him holy hands without wrath and doubting.</hi> And let our own Houſes be Temples, or Houſes of Prayer, in which at morning and evening, and at noon day, let us be ſure to pray, and that inſtantly for the ſafety of the King, and the Royal Family, and the preſervation of our Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Religion, as it is now by Law Eſtabliſh'd, <hi>that we may lead quiet and peaceable lives in all godlineſs and honeſty.</hi> Let us be ſo wiſe as to conſecrate large portions of our time to, and be frequent in Prayer, eſteem it an high and eminent expreſſion of Love and Loyalty to your Prince, and of Zeal for our Religion to commend them often to the care and protection of the Almighty: No Man can have ſuch a multitude or hurry of Affairs, but that, as Religion obliges him, he may ſpare ſome time every day to be ſpent in devotion, and it will be no interruption to them if he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten preſent that ſhort, but moſt comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive petition of our Liturgy to Heaven, <hi>Oh Lord ſave the King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if any think, that as the ſurly and ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born Devil in the Goſpel could not be caſt, ſo Popery cannot be kept out by Prayer alone, add Faſting to it, and ſee what they will do u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited; for theſe two together have ever been accounted of great efficacy to remove the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries that People lay under, and to avert the Dangers and Calamities they feared. When that dreadful doom was by <hi>Jonah</hi> denounc'd againſt it, <hi>Yet forty days and Niniveth ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd,</hi>
                  <pb n="243" facs="tcp:44080:140"/> the King Proclaimed a Faſt, and the People obſerved it, heartily bewail'd their Sins, cry'd mightily to God for Mercy, <hi>And he ſaw their works, and repented of the Evil that he ſaid he would do unto them, and he did it not.</hi> And if we take this courſe, humble and afflict our Souls with Faſting, Lament, or be hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sorry for our Sins, our Prayers will be very effectual and ſucceſsful, ſuch prevalent Orators in the Court of Heaven, that none of them will return empty, but bring down the choi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt Bleſſings with them.</p>
               <p>Holy vows too do not only expreſs the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs of our deſires, but enforce or add Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy to our Prayers, when <hi>Jacob</hi> was to take his Journy to <hi>Padan Aram,</hi> he made a vow un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <note place="margin">Gen. 28. 20.</note> the Lord, ſaying, <hi>If God will be with me, and keep me in the way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on, ſo that I come again to my Fathers houſe in peace, then ſhall the Lord be my God, and this ſtone which I have ſet for a pillar, ſhall be Gods houſe, and of all that thou ſhalt give me, I will ſurely give the tenth unto thee.</hi> So may we ſay (but then as he did we muſt be ſure to perform our vow) If the Lord will be with us, and keep us from the Romiſh Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, Cruelties, and Oppreſſions, then ſhall he be our God, him will we Love, Adore, and Magnifie, and his Laws ſhall be ſo dear to us, that we will Reverence, Obey, or Live accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them all our days, and we will expreſs our grateful ſence of ſo high a favour, by ſetting apart liberal portions of our Eſtates to Pious and Charitable uſes, there ſhall be no want as
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:44080:141"/> of Churches to Worſhip him in, ſo of Maintenance for his Prieſts, the Impropriations which Popiſh Avarice and Sacriledg alienated, ſhall by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Piety and Charity be reſtored, and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful proviſion made all over the Nation (if it be not ſufficiently done already) for the relief of the Poor, that our very Enemies ſeeing our good works may be converted to us.</p>
               <p>For to endear the Providence of God over us, and to ſtrengthen or enforce our Prayers, our care muſt be to obey our Religion, to lead the moſt pure and Chriſtian Lives, that the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable purity of our Doctrine may not lye hid in the Books and Monuments of our Church, but diſplay its beauties in our Lives and Actions. This will be moſt Acceptable or Pleaſing to God, render us his Joy and Care; Then he will keep us in Peace and Safety, delight to do us Good, ſuffer none to do us Harm or Violence, but De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy our Enemies, and Plague them that hate us, this is to commit our ſelves to him in well doing, and will invite him to be very tender of, and watchful over us.</p>
               <p>A Nation of ſuch Livers would be a fair, though imperfect reſemblance of Heaven both in their purity and ſafety. If there had been but ten ſuch juſt Men amongſt the mighty crow'd of Sinners in <hi>Sodom,</hi> God would have ſpared them all for their Sakes, their Piety would have been a protection and ſecurity to that brutiſh Rabble, that not only refuſed to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, but hated and derided them for it.</p>

               <p>A good Life, ſetting providence aſide, is of it ſelf a great preſervative, as it keeps Men from running into needleſs dangers, from doing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, and thereby giving provocation to others: Some bring miſery and ruin upon themſelves by the Slanders and Calumnies they are guilty of, ſome by Frauds, Rapines, and Oppreſſions, many by Violence and Murders, multitudes by Treaſons and Seditions, others by Luſt and Intemperance, ſome undo them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by one Sin, and ſome by another, beſides the fearful and eternal Puniſhments they bring upon themſelves after this life: all which are avoyded by a Pious and Chriſtian Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and if all men were truly holy and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, and would continue ſo, they would be perfectly ſafe or free from danger, for all the ſufferings and dangers of the good proceed from them that either caſt off all Religion and Fear of God, or if they profeſs, do not prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe it, but make it a Cloak of Maliciouſneſs, a Cover for all manner of Injuſtice, Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and Cruelties.

               <p>To ſay a Being ſo wiſe, and powerful and merciful as God is, that hath by ſo many and great expreſſions of his Goodneſs proved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a Father and a Friend to, or Lover of mankind, takes no notice or care of them, is to ſay the falſeſt and moſt unreaſonable of all things, becauſe it is either to deny Wiſdom, Power, and Goodneſs, or to make them Superfluous, or of no uſe at all: And if he protect or take care of any, 'tis moſt reaſonable to ſuppoſe the juſt and pious perſons are thoſe he extends that favour to, becauſe they do in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure reſemble him, and are the only Perſons he delights in, for, <hi>The Eyes of the Lord</hi> (ſaith the Prophet) <hi>are over the Righteous, and his Ears are open to their Prayers,</hi> that is, he loves and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours them highly, hears them graciouſly, and therefore guards or defends them carefully.

               <p>Firſt, The lamentable Schiſms or Diviſions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, there being no where more ſharp and bitter contentions, more implacable feuds and quarrels, ſuch numerous and peeviſh Sects, as amongſt us that profeſs the moſt Pure and Primitive Chriſtianity: for by the juſt judgment
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:44080:151"/> of God (our Adverſaries ſay) ever ſince we departed from the Catholick Church (ſo they call the <hi>Roman</hi>) like the Dove that went out of the Ark, we can find no reſt for the Soles of our Feet, cannot agree amongſt our ſelves, nor <hi>follow that Peace, without which and holineſs,</hi> the Apoſtle affirms, <hi>no Man ſhall ſee the Lord,</hi> but divide and ſubdivide, ſeparate or run from one another, and are become a very <hi>Babel</hi> or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion. This they object againſt, and think a mighty reproach to us, nay take it for a ſure Prognoſtick of the approaching fall and ruin of our Church, becauſe our Lord affirms, <hi>that an Houſe or Kingdom divided againſt it ſelf cannot ſtand,</hi> which they uſe as an Artifice to draw People from us.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer, that it is true indeed, our Schiſms or Diviſions are great and deplorable, that we are broken into Sects and Factions, are a diſtracted and divided Nation: But then the Queſtion is, how we came to be ſo, and what the cauſes are from which they ſpring. That the guilt of them doth not ly upon our Church is certain, becauſe it gives no juſt provocation to any to Separate from the Communion of it: it teaches no Falſe nor Erroneous Doctrines, makes no new Articles of Faith, nor any other Conditions of Salvation, but thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded and requir'd as ſuch in Scripture: It ſets up no forbidden Way of Worſhip, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes not to inlarge the Eſſentials of it, or to make any thing a part of Gods Worſhip, which he hath not injoyn'd as ſuch. 'Tis true indeed, our Church determins the modes and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:44080:152"/> of it, becauſe all Churches do it, and they are not determin'd in Scripture, and are ſo neceſſary to be determin'd, that unleſs it be done, the Eſſentials or Moral part of Gods Worſhip cannot be perform'd, and becauſe the leaving them Arbitrary would produce endleſs diſorders and confuſions: But then theſe Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies are not culpable as to their number, unlawful in themſelves, as contrary to the word of God, ſinful in their uſe, as being made means of grace, or having any holineſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to them, or ſo highly eſteemed as to be thought neceſſary to recommend, or render the worſhip it ſelf acceptable or pleaſing to God, nor made of perpetual obligation, but are declared to be mutable Conſtitutions, or ſuch as may be changed or varyed as occaſion ſerves, nay quite aboliſh'd or taken away upon juſt cauſes, by the ſame Authority that Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or Ordained them. The Government alſo of our Church by the Right Reverend Biſhops is that which is Commended in Scripture, was Inſtituted by Chriſt, Setled by his Apoſtles, and hath Continued in the Catholick Church with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any oppoſition, till <hi>Aerius</hi> firſt, and the Diſciples of <hi>Calvin</hi> ſince, reſiſted, and where they had power, caſt it out. I appeal then to all the wiſe and ſober World, whether the Schiſms and Diviſions amongſt us be not cauſeleſs and unprovoked, there being no juſt offence given, nothing done by our Church to fright or drive the People from the Communion of it, or prompt them to ſet up ſeveral Meetings. And if the Diviſions we are afflicted with cannot be
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:44080:152"/> truly charged upon the Church, where muſt the Blamely, or who ſhall father the baſe and miſchievous Brat.</p>
               <p>They that lay it at the Jeſuits door, charge them to be both the beginners and continuers of the Schiſms amongſt us, have reaſon for what they ſay, becauſe the Zealots of that Church think every thing lawful that tends to the good and advantage of the Catholick Cauſe: And nothing can be more ſerviceable to that than our Diviſions and Quarrels: divide and rule, is a Maxim approved by all the Wicked Politicians; If they can but ſet thoſe they would maſter at ſtrife and variance, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude they will thereby ſo weaken and conſume one another as to become an eaſy prey to them. Such Diviſions Produce deadly feuds and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, implacable hatreds and animoſities, and are the Cauſes of cruel Wars; for Differences in Religion are for the moſt part managed with ſuch heat and paſſion, that the contenders pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from words to blows, from diſputing to fighting for their beloved Opinions, or if they forbear that for a time, yet in any exigences of State or Publick dangers, they will not afford one another that mutual help and aſſiſtance, which are neceſſary for their preſervation, but one party will look on, and ſee the other ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, if not lend their helping hands to deſtroy them: But the more united any people are, the better able they muſt needs be to defend themſelves againſt a common Enemy, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing broken into Sects and Factions, their ſtrength is Little, and not Sufficient to repel
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:44080:153"/> the aſſaults of their Enemies. <hi>Cyrus,</hi> as <hi>Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotus</hi> relates, intending to Conquer <hi>Scythia,</hi> came to a great River that ſtop'd his march, for as it ran in one channel or current it would have Endanger'd his Army, Swallowed them up if they had ventured to ford it, whereupon he made uſe of this Stratagem, to cut or divide it into many parts, rivulets, and ſluces, which ſo weaken'd its force that they paſſed over with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any danger at all: This ſeems to be the Policy of the Jeſuits in dividing us, for if all our people kept within their proper Channel, our Church, the attempts of <hi>Rome</hi> would ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify nothing, but like a mighty torrent we ſhould eaſily bear down all oppoſition, be ſtrong enough to defend ourſelves againſt them; but the Sects and Factions they have cauſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, weaken and give them great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages againſt us; For hereby many are Scandaliz'd and turn Papiſts, becauſe they think the Contentions we are ingaged in will be ſure to ruin us at laſt, and therefore imagin themſelves ſafer in St. <hi>Peters</hi> boat, than in a ſhip ſo leaky and full of breaches, as our Church is. By this means alſo great numbers are frighted from Religion in general, become Atheiſts, conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that to be a meer Fable, about which there are ſo many and ſuch endleſs quarrels and bickerings, and which the profeſſors of, after ſo long time, and ſo much conſideration, are not, will never be agreed about, and it is indifferent to them that believe all Religion a cheat, which gets uppermoſt, for they that are really of none, can and will ſeem to be of any Church
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:44080:153"/> or Perſwaſion they can either get or ſave by, if either their ſafety or profit require it, they can creep as devoutly to a Crucifix as they can kneel to God Almighty. Laſtly, by drawing multitudes of People from it, the Jeſuits have great hopes of gaining their ſo much deſired, and ſo long endeavour'd point, <hi>The deſtruction of our Church;</hi> for we ſee how Zealous and Induſtrious the Diſſenters have been and are to ruin or pluck it down, which ſhews them to be ſet on by the Jeſuits, and their Agents, to do their work for them (though perhaps they know not, do not conſider whoſe ſervants they are) for if our Church be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd, Popery will certainly riſe out of the ruins of it, there being nothing to make head againſt it when that is gone, this is the great Bulwork or Fort Royal, which if they can take either by undermining Treachery, or open Force, the day is theirs. So that they who charge our Diviſions upon the Jeſuits, as the Authors of them, have reaſon to juſtify that charge, and the truth of it is ſo fully proved by the excellent Dean of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to his <hi>unreaſonableneſs of Separation</hi> (to which I refer the Reader) that nothing needs <note place="margin">Page 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And being the firſt Sowers of theſe Tares, the Cauſers and Fomenters of our Diviſions, when they broak in upon our Church preſently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Reformation, and which they have with their utmoſt care and diligence propagated and continued ever ſince, with what face can they Upbraid us with, or make them an Objection
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:44080:154"/> againſt it? for them to ſet us together by the Ears, and then blame us that we do not agree, to be the Incendiaries and ſtir up Strife amongſt us from Age to Age, from Generation to Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and then reproach us with our Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, is worſe than Heathen Malice and Kna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very; this is as barbarous as if a Man ſhould ſet his Neighbours Houſe on fire, and then blame him for letting it burn. We had lived in great Peace and Concord, and there had been no Schiſms amongſt us, if they had not help'd to diſturb the one, and promoted the other, and our Wounds would be preſently cloſed, we ſhould return to our Ancient Unity, and live in the happieſt Peace, if They and their chief A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents, the leading Schiſmaticks, that imbroyl and divide us, were (as upon all accounts they deſerve to be) <hi>Excluded</hi> or Driven out of the Nation. 'Tis certain that not only all Proteſtants, but the Papiſts themſelves at the beginning of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign came to our Churches, and if <hi>Pius Quintus</hi> had not forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den the Romiſh party to Communicate with, they had not Separated from us, and his Emiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries the Prieſts and Jeſuites, did under colour of ſetting up a more Pure and Spiritual way of Worſhip, ſeduce many Proteſtants from the Church, and cauſe woful broyls and diſſentions, which put that prudent and excellent Queen upon ſuch methods as did effectually ſuppreſs and quiet them, and it is moſt Unreaſonable, and right Jeſuitical practice, for them to father their baſe and wicked off-spring upon us, to cauſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:44080:154"/> amongſt us, and then reproach us with them.</p>
               <p>Beſides, they that thus accuſe and upbraid us with ours, have many differences amongſt themſelves, thoſe of their Religious Orders are notorious, and managed with great heat and earneſtneſs. There are many bickerings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them about thoſe points in which they differ from us: They are not agreed where to place the Infallibility, whether in the Pope alone, or a General Council alone, or in both of them together. They differ about his Supremacy, for ſome of them affirm that he hath no Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over Princes, to give, take away or alienate their Kingdoms, and that he unjuſtly aſſumes to himſelf ſuch Authority; others as ſtifly aſſert or maintain that extravagant &amp; uſurped Power, cry it up as high as they can, hoping thereby to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance themſelves. Some affirm, others deny him to be Univerſal Biſhop. They are not agreed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Latine Service, for ſome of them hold it would be more for the Edification of the People if it were in the Vulgar Tongue. They claſh about the Worſhip that is to be given to <hi>Images,</hi> and what the <hi>due honour</hi> is, which the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> decrees to be given to them. They differ about the Power of Prieſts to remit ſin, about the neceſſity and inſtitution of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricular Confeſſion. They do not agree in the Doctrine of Juſtification, nor of Merit, nor concerning the Sacrifize of the Maſs, nor the Communion under one kind, nor in divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, and how is it poſſible they ſhould? for having choſen Opinions that do not cohere
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:44080:155"/> or hang together, they muſt needs diſagree a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them, and if their Tyrannical Diſcipline did not awe and ſuppreſs them, their differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces would be as great and irreconcileable as any are in the World; for when they wrangle loudeſt, if his Holyneſs do but threaten them with the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> they are as quiet as Lambs and dare not mutter at all. And if any deſire farther ſatisfaction in the Caſe, they may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult the excellent Dean of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> in his Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Diſcourſe of <hi>the Diviſions of the Church of</hi> Rome, where their differences and diſlentions are fully proved and ſtated, and their falſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences to peace ſhamed and confuted. So that the unity they brag ſo much of is that of ſlaves, who are forc'd to be quiet for fear of the whip, let the holy <hi>Inquiſitors</hi> ſcourge them, not with Rods as peeviſh Children are corrected, but with Scorpions as incorrigible offendors are puniſh'd. And if their Church was not upheld by force and cruelty, and the People kept in it like Beaſts in a Pound, it would ſoon fall to pei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and be the veryeſt <hi>Babel</hi> in the World. And till they have better peace and agreement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelves, they may be aſhamed to upbraid us with thoſe diviſions, they are the miſchievous Authors and Promoters of.</p>
               <p>'Tis certain too that our Diviſions had never grown ſo great, nor continued ſo long, if the Laws had been duly Executed upon the Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks, for the juſt corrections they decree againſt the troublers of this our <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the diſturbers of our Peace, if inflicted, would have obliged them to give over their wicked
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:44080:155"/> and dangerous practices. Such diſorders and diſſentions (as I remark'd before) by the Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Emiſſaries, broak out with great Violence in the Reign of Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi> but by the juſt ſeverity of her Laws, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and impartially Executed, ſhe ſoon maſter'd and ſubdued them, and her Succeſſour King <hi>James</hi> by the watchful and diligent uſe of the ſame means might have ſuppreſs'd them, and ſetled the Nation in firm and laſting Peace, if he had pleaſed, but the favour that was ſhew'd them, the mild and gentle uſage they found in the latter part of his Reign, did ſo multiply and encourage that dangerous and ſtubborn Faction, that they were ſtrong enough to bid Defiance to, and Ruin that glorious Prince, King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt. So lamentable an Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour is it for the Government to ſhew favour and clemency to theſe People, who when they have power make it appear by their barbarous Actions that they have no mercy, and no ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty. If they be let alone there is no end of Peoples whimſies and extravagancies in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, their Ignorance betrays them into the wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Errours, they have ſuch odd notions and apprehenſions of it as inſtead of Civilizing, make them Savage and Brutiſh; inſtead of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Juſt, Merciful, Humble, Peaceable, and Obedient to their Prince, prompt them to be Sawcy and Stubborn, Traytors, Heady, High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded, Unjuſt and Cruel, Turbulent and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious: They have ſuch a mighty admiration for every Factious Fellow that will but <hi>Cant</hi> and <hi>Whine,</hi> talke Impudently, and Sillily, and look Demurely, that he may govern them as he
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:44080:156"/> pleaſes, they are his obſequious Slaves, and will venture upon any thing, how baſe, execrable, and damnable ſoever that he prompts them to, and therefore it is the intereſt of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to keep ſuch Seducers from them, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide that they be duly inſtructed in their duty as to God, ſo to their Prince, and if at any time they dare to tranſgreſs the Laws, and grow freakiſh through Religious Zeal, that they be puniſh'd for ſuch dangerous Miſdemeanours. This is abſolutely neceſſary both for the Safety of the Prince, and the Peace of the Kingdom, 'tis not only doing Juſtice upon great and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Offendors, but Charity too, as it Keeps them from doing themſelves and others the greateſt harm and miſchief, Curbs or Reſtrains the madneſs of the People. This is the wiſe and juſt method the Government now uſes to Remedy theſe Evils, to bring the wild Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks to their Wits again, to reduce them to bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Manners and a more Quiet or Submiſſive Temper, and it will, if duly and diligently fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, put an end to our Diviſions; then we ſhall live as Chriſtians ought to do, in Love, Peace and Unity, <hi>with one mind and one mouth glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> then our united Prayers will call down the choiceſt Bleſſings upon us, and none can make our diſcords a pretence to run from our Church, becauſe that ſcandal will be removed; then our Differences will be compoſed, our Breaches repaired, and the Diviſions we have ſo long labour'd under, will be no more an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection againſt us; then our Ruin will be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:44080:156"/> our Enemies put to ſilence, and we ſhall be an happy People, which that God, who is the Author and Lover of Peace, mercifully grant for his Sons Sake.</p>
               <p>The next Scandal or Offence that would be taken away, is the open Prophaneneſs or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety into which the Nation is lapſed, for all (that do not wilfully ſhut their eyes) may ſee how our Ancient Piety and Holineſs are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay'd, that though we profeſs the beſt and pureſt Religion, yet a great part of the Nation are ſadly debauched, lead very impure and vitious lives, which is the more to be admired and lamented, becauſe, both our Religion and Laws condemn and forbid ſuch vile and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian practiſe. The profeſs'd Atheiſm, and the open Scorning or Deriding all Religion, how intolerable are they in a Chriſtian King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and ſuch horrid crimes as are ſufficient of themſelves (if we had no other guilts) to ruin the Nation by calling down the moſt dreadful judgments upon us, and provoking God to caſt us off? In former Ages they that were ſo unreaſonable as to deny the Author of their being, and the great Creator of the World, were yet ſo cautious as to conceal their impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous unbelief of his Exiſtence; with their mouths they did not, durſt not, though in their hearts they ſaid with the fool, <hi>There is no God:</hi> but now ſuch an one is laugh'd at as a timerous and ſneaking Atheiſt, as a modeſt ungentile Infidel, that dares not ſet his mouth againſt Heaven, and tell all the wiſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious part of Mankind they ly, if they
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:44080:157"/> ſay there is a God. This is ſuch brazen and impudent wickedneſs, that the very Heathens abhor'd, and ſeverely puniſh'd it. What a ſhame is it then that ſuch monſters of men ſhould dare in a Chriſtian State openly to deny the God it Worſhips, of whoſe Exiſtence there is ſo much rational Evidence, ſo many mighty Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments and convincing Proofs (as hath been ſhew'd by many learned Writers of our Church) that can permit no man to be an Atheiſt, but he whoſe horrid contempt of Him, and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of his Laws cauſe to deſpair of finding mercy from him, and to think his crimes ſo great that he will not forgive them? 'Tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that all wicked men wiſh with all their hearts there were no God to call them to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for their lewd and filthy living, but their wiſhing of it will not make him ceaſe to be, who is as certainly as they deny him, he whom they now renounce and ſcoff at will one day recken with them for all the affronts they have put upon him, <hi>who will laugh at their calamity, and mock when their fear cometh,</hi> and we might leave them to be puniſh'd by his vengeance and their own debaucheries, but that they are ſo miſchievous to the ſtate. For ſetting the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation it gives to God aſide, this open A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſm ought not to be ſuffer'd, becauſe it is moſt pernicious to the Government: For is not this the Foundation of all that Honour and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, which men pay to Soveraign Princes, that they are Gods Vicegerents, derive their Power and Authority from him, and Govern the World in his ſtead, are his Repreſentatives
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:44080:157"/> and Commiſſioners? but they that ſay there is no God deny all this, make Empire or Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion a meer humane creature, and ſo free men from the ſtrongeſt and moſt effectual obligations to obedience, which Religion lays upon them, and put thoſe weak ones (which are eaſily broaken) in their ſtead, Intereſt, want of Oppertunity, fear of temporal Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For ſuch men will obey the Prince no longer than he heaps his Royal favours and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits upon them, than he advances and inriches them, when he turns the ſtreams of his bounty from them they are diſobliged, and watch for an Opportunity to depoſe him, and when ever they think it ſafe to make head againſt him, or can find a Powerful Faction to lead, they will be ſure to Rebel, becauſe then they fear no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from the Prince in this, and believe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that Religion ſpeaks of the Puniſhments of the other World. But he that believes there is a God, and Princes to Reign by Him, by his Order and Appointment, that he requires all their Subjects to Reverence and obey them, and that he will inflict Eternal Puniſhments upon all, that for any cauſe whatſoever Rebel or take Arms againſt them, this Man cannot, dares not, ſo long as he believes theſe things, refuſe to pay them all due honour and obedience. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for their own Sakes, as well as for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of their Glorious Founder, it is the great Intereſt and Concern of Princes to puniſh open and profeſs'd Atheiſts, as his, and their moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Enemies, eſpecially thoſe that make it their Common practice to expoſe, and render
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:44080:158"/> every thing ridiculous that is believed by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to bear his Name and Inſcription, laugh at his Laws which he hath given us to direct our Lives and Actions, as injurious and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable impoſitions, that require Men to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny themſelves the Pleaſures and Delights of the World, to part with every thing that is dear to them, to endure Poverty and Death, and all the miſeries of the World, and all this to obtain Rewards, and avoid Puniſhments which are to commence after this Life. Theſe and all their other Blaſphemies againſt God, and his Son Chriſt Jeſus, and his moſt Wiſe, Holy, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Religion, would be ſeverely and exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plarily puniſh'd, and one ſuch Decree, as King <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> made in honour of God would effectually ſtop the mouths of theſe bold Sinners, and Miſchievous as well as Impudent Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers. <hi>Therefore I make a decree that every Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Dan. 3. 29.</note> 
                  <hi>Nation, and Language, which ſpeak any thing amiſs againſt the God of Shadrach, Meſhach, and Abednego, ſhall be cut in peces, and their houſes ſhall be made a dunghill, becauſe there is no other God that can deliver after this ſort:</hi> Such a <hi>Bill of Excluſion</hi> as this, to ſhut Atheiſm Blaſphemy, and Prophaneneſs out of the Nation, and the ſtrict Execution of the good Laws already in being, upon all the Reigning Sins that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, would conduce mightily to the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and preſervation of our Religion, both as it would prevail with God to continue it amongſt us, and diſcourage our Enemies from attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the ſubverſion and deſtruction of it.</p>
               <p>Firſt, prevail with God to continue it amongſt us, for when he ſees a Nation or People have
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:44080:158"/> that high honour and eſteem for his Laws, as to obey them heartily, make it their chief ſtudy and endeavour to live up to them, priſe them above all Earthly Injoyments, and admire them as the moſt precious Treaſure; his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs will not permit him to take them from ſuch a People, becauſe they anſwer all the ends he propoſed to himſelf in the donation of them, which are his Honour and their Salvation: His honour that he might be glorify'd by their Piety and Holyneſs, by all thoſe vertuous Actions and good Works which they perform in obedience to them: Their Salvation, that his bounty and goodneſs in rewarding them with the Immortal Felicities of his Heavenly King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, might appear great and illuſtrious, and be the Subject of their eternal Praiſes and Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings: And if theſe be the ends of his giving of them (as no doubt they are) 'tis reaſonable to believe that by obeying the Laws of Chriſt, by leading the pure and holy Lives his Religion requires of us, we oblige and invite the Divine Goodneſs to preſerve or continue it amongſt us, becauſe we put it to the excellent uſe he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it for. But if we prophane and diſhonour it by lewd and impure living, if we call our ſelves Chriſtians, and live like Heathens, the worſt and moſt brutiſh ſort of Heathens, as we deſerve ſo ſad a puniſhment, ſo it is moſt juſt for God to take his Goſpel from us, it being as our Saviour ſpeaks, <hi>Caſting pearls before ſwine,</hi> to continue a divine and holy Law to People lapſed into all Impurity and Senſual living, for the <hi>Alcoran</hi> is fitter for ſuch vile people than
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:44080:159"/> the Goſpel, becauſe that allows them to be as vicious as they pleaſe, but this conſiſts of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever things are true, and honeſt, and juſt, and pure, and lovely, and of good report, of all thoſe excellent vertues that can raiſe and advance our nature, make us holy, juſt, and merciful as our Heavenly Father is, and both requires, and with the moſt perſwaſive Arguments preſſeth us to the practiſe of them, which if we refuſe to do, as we caſt contempt and reproach upon our Religion, ſo we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke God to take it from us, unleſs we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent ſo ſad and deplorable a loſs by our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned Repentance, as our Lord admoniſh'd the Angel of the Church of <hi>Epheſus, Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Revel. 2. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>and do the firſt works, or elſe I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy Candleſtick out of his place</hi> (take my Goſpel from thee) <hi>except thou repent.</hi> Let it be the care then of all that are in Authority to ſuppreſs the great and crying Sins, to <hi>Exclude</hi> the bold and reigning wickedneſs out of the Nation, and there will be no fear but God will be <hi>With us,</hi> and continue his Goſpel, or the true Religion amongſt us.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this will be an excellent <hi>Expedient</hi> to ſecure our Religion, as it will diſcourage our Enemies from attempting the Subverſion and Deſtruction of it, when they ſee us lead the pure and blameleſs lives it requires of us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold our good Converſation in Chriſt, they will be aſhamed to call us Hereticks, being an holy People, a Pious and Righteous Nation, they will fear that what <hi>Balaam</hi> ſaid of <hi>Iſrael</hi> will be
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:44080:159"/> verifi'd in us, <hi>ſurely there is no Inchantment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Jacob, neither is there any divination againſt</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Numb. 23. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>Iſrael:</hi> 'Tis in vain (they will ſay) for us to Plot or Enterprize againſt them, their Piety makes them dear to God, and their Innocence is their protection, we may ruin our ſelves but we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hurt them, ſo long as they adhere to God he will not forſake them, not ſuffer them to be caſt down, nor let any harm happen to them, the Arrows we ſhoot at them will wound our ſelves, and we ſhall fall into the Deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we intended for them: Nay when they ſee us add to our pure Faith a Vertuous and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Life, they will be tempted to admire and think our Church a Lovely Image or Reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of Heaven, in which Righteouſneſs Reigns, and from which Wickedneſs is Baniſh'd or Excluded, and that admiration will be a powerful inducement to invite or draw them to us, urge them to leave their Idols and joyn in the pure Worſhip we preſent unto God, perſwade them to turn from darkneſs to light, from their Sinful and Diſconſolate Superſtition, to our Holy Religion, which fills our Souls with Joy and Comfort now, and leads them to Eternal Bliſs and Pleaſures. But if we continue in our preſent Impieties they will ſcorn us and our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion for them, deſpiſe us as humourſome and perverſe People that hold the truth in unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, the purity of our Doctrine, being co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd with the filth and rubbiſh of our Vices, will be ſullyed and look dim, not appear at all lovely or inviting to them; they will think they have reaſon to hate us, becauſe our wicked Lives have made us hated of God, and will be
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:44080:160"/> confident either of his approbation of, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivance at their deſigns and attempts againſt us, believe God is not for us, and therefore that they may ſafely and ſucceſsfully be againſt us. They will call us Hypocrites for finding fault with their way of Worſhip, whilſt our wilful Sins defile our own: With what face (they will ask) can you charge us with giving too much Honour to the Saints, when you account their Lives to be Folly, deny them that which all the Chriſtian World confeſſes to be due to them, even the Honour of Imitation, refuſe to follow their good Examples, and have very few Reliques or remains of their Piety amongſt you? How dare you blame us for the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of our Ceremonies, when you have turn'd all Religion into a Ceremony, or meer Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement, ſaying, Lord, Lord, but do not the will of God? If it be unlawful for us to aſſert the merit, how abominable is it in you to deny the neceſſity of good works, as it is evident, you do by refuſing to perform them? If our Church be guilty of ſome Errours, your Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are defiled with many Impieties, and need another Reformation; why then are you ſuch Hypocrites as to take notice of the <hi>mote in our eye, and not to caſt the beam out of your own.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus will they upbraid and reproach us, and having ſo much to object, encourage them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in miſchief againſt us, and therefore as it ought to be the great and earneſt care of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Perſons to reform what is amiſs in their Lives, ſo of all that are in Authority both to be Examples of Piety to the People and by Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:44080:160"/> the Laws upon them <hi>to be a terrour to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil doers,</hi> that our Religion may neither be diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd nor endanger'd by the Impieties of the Profeſſors of it, that God may not be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked to take it from us, our Enemies encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged to attempt againſt it, nor any be offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or tempted to run from it, becauſe we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace it by our unſuitable lives, but that every thing be removed that may ſtain the beauty, obſcure the glory of it, render men fugitives from, rather than Converts to it.</p>
               <p>The other great Scandal which I deſire may be removed, is the high Injuſtice and Indignities that have been offer'd to the Duke himſelf, 'tis certain that he hath had the hardeſt meaſure, and the greateſt injury tender'd him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in Juſtice ought to have ſome proprotion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able reparation made him, which that it may be effected, 'tis my requeſt to the People that they will make a better choice whenſoever the King pleaſes to call a Parliament. Let it be your care, my beloved Countrymen, to Elect Loyal and Honeſt Men, Men that fear God, and hate Iniquity or unjuſt dealing, that dare depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God in the uſe of fair and Innocent means, for the ſecurity of our Religion, and every thing elſe that is dear to them, and will not do a baſe or unworthy thing to ſave them.</p>
               <p>You ſee what irreparable injury and horrid miſchief, the Fanatick Faction, thoſe great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers of the <hi>Bill of Excluſion,</hi> would have done you, took away the breath of your Noſtrils, the Anoynted of the Lord, by a moſt barbarous and execrable <hi>Aſſaſination,</hi> they had Plotted
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:44080:161"/> (and if the merciful God had not prevented them) would have kil'd your King, a King under whoſe wiſe and juſt Government you live in Piety, Peace, and Plenty, injoy all the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings you can deſire, or Heaven can give you in this World, a Prince that loves you, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults your welfare, and is always Solicitious or thoughtful to ſecure your quiet and happineſs.</p>
               <p>His Royal Brother too, ſhould have been murder'd with him, and as they are conjoyn'd in blood and the deareſt affection, ſo the ſame untimely and cruel fate was intended for them both, that Life which his Royal Highneſs had ſo bravely ventured for the ſafety and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of his Country, ſhould by the moſt exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable treachery and baſeneſs have been took from him.</p>
               <p>And do, or can you think they that had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired the deſtruction of two ſuch excellent Princes, would, if their helliſh deſign had ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, have been either merciful or juſt to you? No, no! Multitudes of you had periſh'd by their bloody Swords, and thoſe that had eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped would have lead a Life worſe than Death, the Life of Slaves, a life made miſerable and tedious by continual fears and intolerable op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions. The Eſtates your careful Parents left you, or which you have obtained by your own Labour and Induſtry, would have been a prey to theſe your new Maſters, and when they had been devour'd, you muſt have drudg'd for more to glut their inſatiable coveteouſneſs.</p>
               <p>I conjure you therefore by all that is dear to you, by the Honour, Love, and Loyalty you
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:44080:161"/> bear to the King, and as you tender your own ſafety and happineſs, to chuſe none of the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluders,</hi> none that gave their votes for that (as I ſuppoſe I have proved it) wicked <hi>Bill,</hi> or are known to be admirers and favourers of it, if you do, you are partakers in their guilt, cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate new trouble and diſquiet, vexation and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to the King, offer freſh injuries and indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities to his Royal Highneſs, caſt more reproach and diſhonour upon our Religion, encourage men of Trayterous and Wicked Principles to Plot and Imagine more miſchief, and ſo bring your ſelves and the Kingdom into miſery and ruin.</p>
               <p>Be wiſe then, and let not remote and diſtant, if not imaginary, prompt you to expoſe the King, the whole Nation, and conſequently your ſelves to preſent and real dangers, but take the firſt opportunity to remedy all theſe evils: There is no want of loyal and brave perſons (thanks be to God) that are able and ready to ſerve him, their King, and you in that high Station, if you pleaſe to make choice of them, you may know them by their fruits, their <hi>Addreſſes and Abhorrences,</hi> that is, by the Declarations they have made of their Loyalty, and Reſolution to ſtand by and defend the Kings moſt Sacred Maieſty with their Lives and Eſtates againſt all his Enemies, and all Traytors both Popiſh and Fanatick, and their proteſtations of their diſlike and hatred of the injurious Treatment that hath been offer'd to his Royal Highneſs. Theſe are the men that muſt cloſe our gaping wounds, heal our rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:44080:162"/> Diſſentions, appeaſe our deadly Feuds and Differences, and reſtore us to our Ancient Peace and Happineſs: But the other are Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians of no value, their Phyſick is too violent, inſtead of recovering it would deſtroy the Patient, they are not for moderate Counſels, but run into dangerous extreams, bring fuel to feed, inſtead of water to quench the Feuds and Contentions that burn ſo fiercely amongſt us. Be ſure then to leave out theſe, and chuſe the other, the Men of Loyalty and Integrity, who as they hate Popery, ſo they do heartily love Righteouſneſs, theſe will pleaſe God and the King, and it will be an high honour and a great happineſs to you, and the whole Nation to have ſuch <hi>excellent Repreſentatives.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And hoping the next Houſe of Commons will conſiſt of ſuch worthy Patriots and Members, I humbly petition that, then, truly Honourable Houſe, that they will pleaſe to do that, which God and all good men expect from them, and their own loyalty and generoſity cannot but prompt them to, that they will make ſome grateful and ſuitable Returns to the King for all his Royal care, watchfulneſs, moſt prudent and happy endeavours to preſerve us in Peace, and ſecure our excellent Church, and moſt holy Religion from all the attempts of all its Enemies. The Ship of State, and all its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Lading muſt needs have periſh'd, when the winds of Sedition blew ſo lowd, and the waves of Faction raged, and the ſtorms of popular Tumults beat ſo Furiouſly againſt it, if his Royal hand had not Guided the helm,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:44080:162"/> ſtear'd an even and a wary courſe. But, Oh, what care and labour, how many anxious thoughts, ſleepleſs nights, and painful days did it coſt him to weather the Storm? And can you be ſo ungrateful as to overlook his Royal labours to attain this reſt, and render him no agreeable returns for them? It cannot be! your Loyalty will not, your Piety cannot ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer you to be ſo unmindful either of your own Duty, or his Princely Care and Goodneſs to you. As you have congratulated his delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and paid your ſolemn thanks to Heaven for it, and in his your own, ſo let it be your care to put his Sacred Majeſty into ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, by your liberal Supplies, that he may be able to defend himſelf, and you, and all his good Subjects from the Violence and Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties of all the Diſturbers of the Peace, and Deſtroyers of the Happineſs you injoy under his Royal Care, and moſt prudent Government.</p>
               <p>This is a Tribute your gratitude cannot, your wiſdome will not deny to ſuch a Prince, that ſo tenderly loves, ſo watchfully protects you; and having fill'd Heaven with thanks for the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful preſervation of his Sacred Perſon and moſt Precious Life, and all parts of the Nation with your admirations and praiſes of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable Wiſdom, Juſtice, and Goodneſs, what an unpardonable Soleciſm and Errour will it be, to give encouragement to the Wicked and Seditious to enterpriſe or attempt any thing againſt him, by reaſon of the emptineſs of his Exchequer.</p>
               <p>To keep the Prince poor is dangerous to the People, both becauſe it renders him unable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="272" facs="tcp:44080:163"/> to protect them, and alſo abates their fear, and thereby animates his and their Enemies to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt againſt him, and to endeavour the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertion of the Government. And it is very reaſonable to believe the late proceedings had never run ſo high, but that the Authours of them preſumed upon the neceſſities of the King, they thought (though with ſtrange Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and Impiety) he would deny them no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing they demanded of him, in hopes of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting mony of them. All which evils it is now in your power to prevent, the Nation by His Majeſties Providence and excellent Conduct is in a flouriſhing condition, the Loyal Party are ſo willing to give, that if you do not make haſt, they will Aſſeſs themſelves rather than their Prince ſhall want, and the Diſafected can find mony Voluntarily to contribute towards the Subverſion and Deſtruction of the Government, and therefore ſhould be forced to pay towards the Suport and Preſervation of it. If the wicked Conſpirators had prevailed in their late villanous Deſign, both your Lives and Eſtates had been a prey to their barbarous Cruelty, and inſatiable Covetouſneſs, and having e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcaped ſo dreadful a Danger, and ſuch immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Ruin, take heed how you encourage them to imagine any more Miſchief, by denying the Ring ſuch Supplies as are neceſſary for his, and yours, and all our preſervation.</p>
               <p>Let it be your care alſo to cover the Pit which the <hi>Excluders</hi> have dug, I mean, to make his Royal Highneſs reparation for the injurious and unworthy Treatment he hath received from
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:44080:163"/> them: You have abhorr'd it without doors, therefore do it within, caſt out the <hi>Bill</hi> as a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed &amp; abominable thing, &amp; ſhut the door after it, that it may never return any more. Be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to do that, which your great Wiſdom and Juſtice cannot but prompt you to, Go to the Duke and let him know your deep reſentments of the wrongs that have been offer'd him, and beſeech him not to think the worſe either of you, or the Eſtabliſh'd Religion for them, becauſe this hath taught you, and all the true Members of the Church of <hi>England</hi> to abominate the <hi>Project of Excluſion</hi> as a peice of high and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable Injuſtice. Shew him the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the true, and the ſeeming Proteſtants, that thoſe have ſo much Religion and fear of God, that they dare do injury to no man, much leſs to their Princes, and had rather ſuffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves than they ſhould, whereas theſe have more Zeal than Honeſty, and care not whom they injure and oppreſs, ſo they can but ſecure and preſerve their own dear ſelves. Treat him with all the honour and reſpect due to his Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Birth &amp; Vertues, omit nothing that may teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie your high eſteem and veneration for him, uſe all the fair and prudent means you can, to gain his favour and good opinion of you, and to convince him of the juſtneſs and honeſty of your intentions towards him.</p>
               <p>Such methods as theſe are Chriſtian and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and fit to be practis'd towards a Prince, and may by the Bleſſing of God work very much upon his great and generous Soul (brave Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits being ſometimes courted to that which they
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:44080:164"/> will never be hector'd into) and (if he be a Papiſt) be inſtrumental to his Converſion, which will not only be grateful or pleaſing to God, his Angels and Saints in Heaven, but fill this our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Earth with Joy, revive our lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing Happineſs, reſtore our Nation to its ancient Glory, put a bleſſed period to all our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions and Confuſions, then we ſhall live in Peace and Unity amongſt our ſelves, and, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we be the moſt ungrateful People in the World, in true Piety &amp; Obedience to our God, who hath done ſo great things for us; then it will be well with us, and happy ſhall we be, &amp; Forreigners will call theſe Kingdoms as they did of old, <hi>The Fortunate Iſlands:</hi> All which the great and Gracious Governour of the World, God Almighty, in whoſe hands the Hearts of Princes are, Grant for the Merits of our dear Redeemor.</p>
